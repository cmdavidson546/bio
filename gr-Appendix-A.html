        You have heard it said that “Faith over Works leads to salvation,” and not the other way around.   If we imagine this statement as an equation, we can manipulate it mathematically in order to draw several conclusions based on human reason:

Faith/Works=Salvation

If we imagine Salvation as whole number of 1 (unity with and of God), indicating completeness of salvation attainable by a single individual, we can see that in order to be equal to 1 unit of salvation, we must have a ratio of faith and works that is in direct proportion to that whole value.  In this way, it seems that salvation can only be attained by having some rational relationship between the two concepts.  In mathematics, there are several rules that must be obeyed when equating ratios.  First, any number divided by 0 is “UNDEFINED,” which means it produces an invalid output.  Here, if we divide the fraction by “0 works” then we get an output that is invalid and thus salvation is not possible.  This is the idea that if a person who has complete faith in the Lord, but does not ACT on that faith, then they are missing something that is vital to their faith.  A person who loves God with all their heart, will ultimately be prompted to act on that faith – giving to the poor, volunteering, evangelizing, etc.  NEED QUOTES HERE.

Second, any number dividing into zero, while defined, is always zero.  Thus, in this example, no matter how much work you do that is good for the Kingdom of God, if you do not have faith than you will not have Jesus, and thus salvation is impossible.  This is what Jesus means when he says, “I do not know you, get away from me…” (QUOTE).  Also, Paul says, “QUOTE”.

If we can state that mathematics is the underpinning of human reason (without getting into the philosophy of that statement) than we can start to manipulate the ratio to see several things happen:

We can always get rid of a fraction by multiplying the denominator (bottom number) on both sides of the equation, thus:

Works*  Faith/Works=Salvation*Works

Faith=Salvation*Works


Here we see that Faith produces (equals) salvation and (good) works.  While still keeping the character of full salvation (having a whole number value of 1), faith by itself should produce both Good Works and Full Salvation.


But, again, by manipulating the result, dividing both sides by salvation to isolate works, we get something less than Salvation (less than a whole number of 1 salvation per 1 person):

Faith/Salvation=  (Salvation*Works)/Salvation  

  Faith/Salvation=Works


Here we get Works producing (equal to) 1/Salvation * Faith, which is something less than full salvation and does not produce a whole value of salvation.  Thus, works alone can never produce salvation.

Thus, in order to produce a full value of salvation, we must find a balance (a ratio, if you will) of faith and works that seeks to equal such value.  In one case, too much faith with a little bit of works (such as the ratio 2/1) would give us more than we need for a full whole number of salvation, while too little faith and mostly works will produce a fraction (such as ½) which would not get us there.  We can see this play out if we manipulate the fraction and multiplying both sides by Works to see that TRUE faith would always lead to both salvation AND works!  Conversely, manipulating the ratio further, we see that Works alone produces something less than full salvation (1/salvation) which is what Jesus meant when he said, “Get away from me…

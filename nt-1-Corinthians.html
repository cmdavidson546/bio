  <h1>New Testament Commentary</h1>

    <h2>The Book of 1 Corinthians</h2>

    <h4>1 Corinthians 1, 2, 3</h4>
    <p>The next letter the NT brings to us after Romans is "First" (1) Corinthians.  We had read in Acts that Paul traveled all around the Greek-speaking world to bring the Good News of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles.  He would stop and stay with various groups of people that accepted his message in the different areas thereby forming a "Church" of Christians in that geographic area.  Corinth was one of those places.  Like I've said, these "Books" of the Bible are the actual letters he wrote (after he moved on in his travels) to encourage and/or correct early believers in keeping the faith according to the will of God.  </p>
    <p>Corinth was a dominant commercial center in the Greek world and promoted the Hellenic (Greek) culture to the fullest extent possible. The city was saturated in pagan worship, sexual immorality and ritual moral laxness.  Corinth had a rather famous pagan temple dedicated to Aphrodite that allegedly was served by 1,000 priestess-prostitutes at the time of Paul's writing.  This thriving Hellenic (Greek) is the background that we should have in mind when we read 1 Corinthians because Paul addresses the early believers and is attempting to correct some bad behavior in the church that has been reported to him.</p>
    <p>1 Cor "10 I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another so that there may be no divisions among you and that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought."</p>

    <h4>1 Corinthians 4, 5, 6</h4>
    <p>Paul has some tough words for the Corinthian believers in these chapters.  Recall my last post about the sexual immorality that plagued the city of Corinth in the 1st century.  Paul takes them to task here and laments against what he has heard from afar about their rampant sexual immorality as believers in Christ.  Their sinful lifestyle was destroying their ability to promote the Gospel to unbelievers in the city of Corinth.  Unbelievers who have never read the Bible today think Christians are hypocrites because on the one hand, we try to tell people what the word of God says about sin, and then yet on the other hand, we go out and do the very sin that is denounced in the Bible.  I am guilty of this.  Another is Mr. George Floyd, who was doing good work for the Kingdom of God in his community for many years, but at the same time, he was also a human being, who struggled with his sin, even after he became a Christian.  The fact of the matter is that Christians are just like every other person on the planet... filled with lust, pride, jealousy, anger, greed and rebellion.  However, the ONLY difference between a Christian and a non-Christian is that the Christian formally recognizes his sin and asks God for mercy and forgiveness... whereas the non-Christian finds no reason to ask for forgiveness to an unseen Creator.</p>
    <p>In the Book of Matthew, Chapter 9, we read, "10 While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples. 11 When the Pharisees [e.g., Jewish leaders] saw this, they asked his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”  12 On hearing this, Jesus said, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. 13 But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”  Paul tells the Corinthian believers, in 1 Cor 6:11, "And that is what some of you were [e.g., people living in sin]. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God."  So, despite being an average human that sins 1000 times a day, faith in Christ "washes" the Christian, removing the stain of sin in our lives and thus paving the way for a light to shine before all men that leads others to repentance and salvation in Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>To be sure, as Christians, we cannot use the sacrifice of Christ as an excuse to sin freely in our lives (re-read Romans again on that topic).  Rather, we are called to seek a pure lifestyle, and in purity, we are called to be an example for the world to show what it means to honor God with our heart, minds and bodies.  But, for unbelievers, before judging Christians as being failures in their faith, I urge you to listen to Paul's words in 1 Cor 4:4, as he says, "It is the Lord who judges me. 5 Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of the heart."  Therefore, let God judge what is right and what is wrong in your life based on a justice system that transcends our meager human reason… because obviously… we do not have “justice” figured out yet.</p>

    <h4>1 Corinthians 7, 8, 9</h4>
    <p>The Corinthians had a lot of questions for Paul about the actual practice of Christianity after he left them in Corinth.  So, after Paul beats these new Christians up verbally, for the first 6 chapters of this book, he starts answering their specific questions in Chapter 7:1, "Now for the matters you wrote about...".  These new believers in Christ ask Paul about all sorts of things like getting married, divorcing, staying a virgin, eating food sacrificed to idols, etc.  The general conclusion from Paul is that we are called by God for a purpose, to bring the Gospel of Jesus Christ to a fallen world, and that is the primary purpose of our lives no matter what the particulars of our life are.  In Christ we are free, not for licentiousness and self-indulgence, but, for the good works of God.  Paul cautions them in Chapter 8:9, "Be careful...that the exercise of your freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak."  Paul is saying, we are free to do what we want because Christ's sacrifice set us free from the bondage of sin, but be careful that the exercise of such freedom does not take away from your primary purpose, which is to serve God before men so that they also can have the same freedom.  As he says in Chapter 9:19, "Though I am free and belong to no man, I make myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possoble."</p>

    <h4>1 Corinthians 10, 11, 12</h4>
    <p>Paul starts Chapter 10 with a history lesson.  The Old Testament is a story of corporate redemption.  The New Testament is a story of individual redemption.  In the pages of the Old Testament we read about Israel, at times turning away from God in favor of worldly living, which led to their destruction, and at other times, turning toward God as a Nation and living according to His commands, which led to peace and blessing in their nation's history.  The Old Testament is the macro-story that fleshes out the micro-details every New Testament believer will have in their own walk with God throughout their life. We can never live up to the standards of a Holy and perfect God (e.g., living according to the Law of the Old Testament).  But for God's plan of redemption, we would be forever bound by the chains of our human frailty and weakness, which causes us to sin, and lead us to death.  Sin, by the Bible's definition is, "a turning away from God."  It has a different meaning than the definition the world gives it in Webster's dictionary.  Sin is any action that separates us from a God who cares deeply about our well being and livelihood and knows what actions will hurt us - spiritually, mentally, emotionally and physically.  But, by believing in the promises of God by faith, we can be set free from the consequences of sin, and from the consequences of the Law, and ultimately receive redemption solely because of our faith in the life and resurrection of His Son Jesus Christ.</p>

    <p>The Old Testament is replete with examples of the consquences of sinning against God's commands.  Paul mentions some here (see Chapter 10).  Most people read these examples as "God wants to punish us"...but I read it as just the natural consequences of our human action... e.g., if you steal (against God's commandment) you go to jail (natural consequences).  In my opinion, the Old Testament demonstrates the patience and kindness of a God who waits and waits on His people to turn back to Him after utterly disregarding His commands for extremely long periods of time.  At some point though, God will cut you off and allow your rejection of Him (if a persistent "turning away from God") to catch up with you in the natural world.  If you don't make a choice at some point in your life to trust Jesus in the here and now then the consequences of your choice will be eternal.  God is not a puppet master and will not "control" us to make us obedient to Him.  We are given "free will" to make a choice for or against God in this life.  He wants a relationship with people who freely make a choice to believe in what He says in the Bible.  You must read God's Word to find out what you are being asked to "trust in" though...please don't take anyone else's word for it.  There will be no "puppet collection" in heaven.  There will, however, be a lot of grateful souls living in eteranl joy who made the choice to trust in Him during this life.</p>

    <p>Paul, after talking about a few of the consequences of sin that the Nation of Israel faced in their history, says in Chapter 10, "11 These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the culmination of the ages has come. 12 So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don’t fall! 13 No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it."</p>

    <p>If you read the Old Testament in light of the New Testament I believe you will find the same answers as I have, namely, God's ways are good and His commandments are not meant to restrain us, but rather meant to provide a path towards a healthy lifestyle that will yield your best life - Do not commit murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not desire your neighbors possessions, etc..  It is these commands that lead to a life well lived and a life pleasing to God.  God knows these things and wants this for your life so He sent us His Son to break it down for us in the most simplest of terms.  This is what Jesus had in mind in Matthew 22:36-40 when He said the greatest command of all is to "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ 40 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”</p>

    <h4>1 Corinthians 13, 14</h4>

    <p>At the end of Chapter 12, Paul is addressing the petty bickering going on inside the church between members fighting over prominance and prestige.  Paul responds with one of his most well-known quotes, for every generation, for 2,000 years:</p>

    <p>"And now I will show you the most excellent way.  13:1 If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. 2 If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 3 If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.</p>

    <p>4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.</p>

    <p>8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. 11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. 12 For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.</p>

    <p>13 And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."</p>

    <h4>1 Corinthians 15, 16</h4>

    <p>Paul closes his first Corinthian letter, after chastising them, then instructing them on particular matters of faith, by reminding them of the Way to eternal life - 15:1, "Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you...2 By this gospel you are saved...3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that he appeared to Cephas [Peter], and then to the Twelve. 6 After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. 7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, 8 and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born."</p>

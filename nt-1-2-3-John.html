<h4>1 John – 1, 2, 3</h4>

<p>No one identifies himself in the letter, but it is generally assumed that John the Apostle wrote this letter (see early church leaders, Irenaeus (140-203), Clement of Alexandria (150 – 215), Tertullian (155-222) and Origen (185 – 253)).  There is not much debate especially when the writing styles and phrases and expressions are compared between the two books/letters.</p>

<p>The opening is similar in ways to John’s Gospel.  Strikingly, he wrote this, most likely, as an old man, and his conviction does not seem to have wavered – “we have heard”, “we have seen”, “we have looked at”, “our hands have touched” – “this we proclaim concerning the Word of life.” (1:1).  John then goes into the message: “This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all.” (1:5).  And, important to our discussion of faith vs. works, the message seems to be a two-part message:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>“But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.” (1:7) [WORKS]</li>

        <li>“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.” (1:9) [FAITH]</li>

    </ol>

<p>John tells us that we know our faith is sufficient for salvation when we are living in obedience to Him who was sent to be an “atoning sacrifice for our sins” – “We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands.” (2:3) And, again, “Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did.” (2:6).</p>

<p>But, how, or what, does “living” or “walking” in the “light” really mean?  “Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness” (2:9).  And, “Do not love the world or anything in the world” because “everything in the world – the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does – comes not from the Father but from the world.” (2:15 – 16).  “Who is a liar?  It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist – he denies the Father and the Son. No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also.” (2: 22 – 23).  “Everyone who has this hope [of Christ’s return] in him purifies himself, just as he is pure.” (3: 3).  “No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him.” (3:6).  “This is how we know who the children of God ar and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not a child of God; nor is anyone who does not love his brother.” (3:10).</p>

<p>“This is how we know what love is...” “we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers” (3:16) and “If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has not pity on him, how can the love of God be in him?” (3:17).  Therefore, “let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth.”  Remember Jesus’ commands: “to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Chris, and to love one another as he commanded us.” (3:23).</p>

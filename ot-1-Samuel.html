  <h1>Old Testament Commentary</h1>

    <h2>The First Book of Samuel (1 Samuel)</h2>

    <h4>Introduction to the book of 1 Samuel</h4>
    
    <p>1 Samuel takes place after a dark period of time in Israel’s history called “Judges”.  At the end of Judges period, the 12 tribes of Israel are fragmented.  Moral decay had sunk into their culture across the land.  See Judges 17 (where the priest Micah fashions idols that become central to his worship life).  They nearly lost the tribe of Benjamin because that tribe was steeped in perversion and moral decay and the other tribes were called to rally against it in battle due to an international incident involving a priest and his concubine.  See Judges 18, 19, 20.  The Benjamites were almost annihilated entirely.</p>

    <p></p>
    
    <p>This was roughly the generation at the tail-end of the grandchildren of Moses and Aaron.  See e.g., Judges 18:30 (where Jonathan, “son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the time of the captivity of the land. They continued to use the idols that Micah had made, all the time the house of God was in Shiloh.”); Judges 20:28 (where “Phinehas, son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron,” was the priest at the tabernacle in the days of Joshua and was still ministering at the ark of the covenant of God, which was in Bethel, in chapter 20).</p>

    <p>The ark of the covenant and the central worship center seems to be a moving target in this pre-Samuel time period which makes dating the precise chronology of Judges and Samuel difficult.</p>

    <p>For example, in Chapter 18 of Judges, the house of the Lord (ark, tabernacle) is in Shiloh (for Shiloh’s destruction see Psalms 78:60 and Jeremiah 7:12, 14; 26:6.  For archeological evidence it appears Shiloh was destroyed around 1050 BC and was left uninhabited for many years).</p>

    <p>However, in Chapter 20, the Israelites go “up to Bethel” to inquire of God where the ark and the High Priest Phinehas were residing.  Judges 20:18.  </p>
    
    
    <p>Then, in 1 Samuel we read that the central worship place is in Shiloh, and so it seems as if Chapter 20 happened prior to Chapter 18 (assuming Bethel was where the ark rested prior to its coming to Shiloh?).</p>

    <p>The Ark's design was revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai. The Ark of the Covenant (Heb. Ahrohn HaBreet) was a small wooden box or chest (approx. 3.9 feet by 2.3 feet) that contained the covenant made by the LORD to the people of Israel.  It was crafted in acacia wood and overlaid with gold, and inside was placed the unbroken stone tablets of the Law, a golden pot of manna, and Aaron's rod that miraculously budded or blossomed. The lid was called the Mercy Seat and it was made from one piece of solid gold, beaten into a shape that revealed two angelic creatures (Cherubim) on each side with wings outstretched. God appeared between the Cherubim where the blood was sprinkled by the high priest on the Day of Atonement. The LORD also appeared and spoke between the Cherubim. There were poles inserted in the rings in each of the 4 corners of the ARK for carrying. When the Israelites journeyed through the wilderness the Ark was carried first by the priests to lead the way. The mysterious Shekinah Glory "Cloud of the LORD" would lead them by day and it became a Pillar of Fire by night. When the people encamped in the wilderness the Tabernacle was set up and the Ark of the Covenant was placed in the Holy of Holies behind the Veil. When they departed the Tabernacle was packed up in an orderly manner.</p>

    <p>A brief overview of the ark and its various locations up to the period of Samuel is as follows:</p>
    
    
    <ul>
        <li>“let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell in them."  Exodus 25:8. (Sinai)</li>
        
        <li>“And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.”  Numbers 10:33-36</li>
        
        <li>After Moses died the children of Israel were led by Joshua into the Land of Canaan. When they came to the Jordan River the waters parted before the Ark of the Covenant. The children of Israel crossed the Jordan and conquered the "Promised Land" with the Ark of the Covenant leading the way.</li>
        
        <li>Later the Tabernacle was erected at a city called Gilgal and the Ark of the Covenant was kept there for a season.</li>
        
        <li>1400 B.C.</li>
        
        <li>Judges 20:18, 26, 27.  The ark of the covenant and the tabernacle were placed in Bethel (within the territory of the tribe of Benjamin).  </li>
        
        <li>Later the Ark was removed and taken to Shiloh where it remained for nearly 400 years.
            <ul>
            
                <li>Judges 18:31 and 19:18. The place in Shiloh where the tabernacle was placed was called the house of the Lord/God.</li>
                <li>1 Samuel 1:3; 3:3. This was the permanent site of the ark of the covenant and tent of meeting until the time of King David and Solomon. The ark of the Lord stood here in Shiloh, where Eli and his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord were. The Lord spoke to little Samuel, who slept near the ark of God. The Lord pronounced a judgement on the house of Eli.</li>           
            
            </ul>
        
        </li>
        
        <li>But, Israel had become so corrupt that they forsook the Lord and worshipped the queen of heaven. The leaders of Israel thought they could use the Ark as a “magical” talisman and sent for the Ark at Shiloh to be brought with them into battle against the Philistines.  The Ark of the Covenant fell into the hands of the Philistines, after they defeated Israel in the battle near Ebenezer.  The Philistines were forced to return the Ark to Israel after many plagues broke out in their land.</li>
        
            <ul>
            
                <li>1 Samuel 4. The Philistines took the ark of God, and on that same day Eli and his two sons died.</li>
                
                <li>1 Samuel 5:1-12. The Philistines took the ark of God and brought it to Ashdod, then from Ashdod to Gath, and thereafter to Ekron. All three were Philistine towns. The ark of the Lord remained a total of seven months in the land of the Philistines (1 Sam. 6:1).</li>  
                
                <li>1 Samuel 6. After the hand of the Lord had dealt heavily with the Philistines, they returned the ark of Lord to Israel, to the town of Beth Shemesh.</li>
                
                <li>1 Samuel 6:19-21. The people of Beth Shemesh looked at the ark of the Lord out of curiosity, and as a result, 50 070 people died (this is a copyist error in the manuscript…NIV states on 70 people and there is no way that 50K people lived in this small town in total). No one may look at or touch the ark (Num. 4).</li>
            
            </ul>
        
        <li>The Ark of the Covenant was then kept at a place called Kiriath-jearim until David was anointed king of Israel and brought the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem until the Temple was erected.</li>   
            <ul>
                
                <li>1 Samuel 7:1, 2. The people of Beth Shemesh then sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath Jearim for them to take the ark of the Lord down to them. The ark of the Lord was taken to the house of Abinadab in the town Kirjath Jearim where it remained for twenty years. Abinadab's son Eleazar was consecrated to take care of the ark of the Lord.</li>
        
            </ul>
        
        <li>1 Samuel 14:18. Saul commanded the priest Ahijah to temporarily bring the ark of the Lord down to the battleground.</li>
        
        <li>2 Samuel 6:1-9. David decided to bring the ark of God to Jerusalem. Uzzah was punished with death because he touched the ark. David, out of fear of the Lord, let the ark turn aside into the house of Obed-Edom. The ark remained in his house for three months (2 Sam. 6:10, 11).</li>
        
        <li>David's son Solomon completed the Temple in Jerusalem and placed the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies.</li>        
        
        <li>Later there was a civil was and Israel was divided, 10 tribes went to the north and the remaining 2 stayed in the south. The Ark of the Covenant remained in the Temple in Jerusalem.</li>
        
        <li>The northern kingdom continually forsook the Lord until God gave them into the hands of the Assyrians and they were deported away in 722 BC. Later the remaining 2 tribes forsook the Lord also and Jerusalem and the Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC. The Bible does not mention what happened to the Ark of the Covenant.</li>       
        
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h4>1 Samuel 1, 2, 3</h4>

    <p>1 and 2 Samuel were originally a single book, but the writers of the Septuagint divided it into two separate books, which was the tradition followed by Jerome and others thereafter.  Most likely written during David’s monarchy.  Authorship is unknown, but whoever wrote it had intimate access to the historical records on the lives of 3 very important men in the earliest days of the new monarchy.  In the book itself, one such source is mentioned – the Book of Jashar, 2 Sa 1:18.  The writer of Chronicles refers to four other possibilities that could have had access enough to write the book of Samuel – the book of the annals of King David (1 Ch 27:24); the records of Samuel the seer; the records of Nathan the prophet; the records of Gad the seer, 1 Ch 29:29.</p>

    <p>Interestingly, 1:3 is also where the first use of “Lord Almighty” is seen in the OT, which up until now had been translated as “Lord of Hosts” in the NIV.  (take a look at other translations and see if this is so in KJV or NAS).</p>

    <p>In 1Sa 1:3 we learn that the Israelites are worshipping at Shiloh (northern part of Ephraim), where the two sons of Eli (Hophni and Phinehas (not the grandson of Aaron?)) were priests for the Lord.  At this time, every Israelite male was required to appear before the Lord at the central sanctuary 3 times per year (see Ex 23:14-19; 34:23; Dt 16:16-17).  Hannah prays to the Lord in the sanctuary and He hears her prayers for a son whom she names Samuel and dedicates him to the service of the Lord for his entire life.  1Sa 1:12 – 20.  </p>

    <p>In 1Sa Chapter 2, Hannah lifts up a prayer of praise and thanksgiving to the Lord that sets up the entire book of Samuel theologically speaking.  Her song here has echoes of the song of David at the end of the book (2Sa 22) and with Mary’s song in Luke 1:46-55).  But, Hannah’s and David’s songs taken together provide book-ends for the narrative of the establishment of Israel’s monarchy through the anointed of God in the book of Samuel.  The supreme source of Hannah’s (re: Israel’s) joy is not the child (re: King) but in the God who has answered her prayer.</p>
    
    <p>After reading the song of praise from Hannah, we next read about the wickedness of Eli’s (priest’s) sons and the prophesy against the house of Eli.  Here, God defines their wickedness in three ways – </p>
    
    <ol>
    
        <li>First, the sons were stealing sacrifices that men made to the Lord during times of worship and thus disobeying the Word of God willfully and intentionally (2:15).  In this case, the priests were only to be apportioned a forkful of boiled meat (prescribed by OT Law, see Lev 7:31-36; 10:14-15; Dt 18:1-5; Nu 6:19-20).</li>
        
        <li>Next, the sons were threatening the worshippers with force in order to break the Law of God when they demanded the food be handed over to them (rather than waiting for it to be boiled as prescribed in Nu 6:19-20).</li>
        
        <li>Third, the sons were sleeping with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting (sexual immorality).</li>
    
    </ol>

    <p>Eli hears the reports of what his sons have been doing and asks, “If a man sins against another man, God may mediate for him; but if a man sins against the Lord, who will intercede for him?”  1Sa 2:25.  </p>

    <p>Eli is a descendant of Aaron.  For the wickedness of the sons of Eli, the Lord pronounces a curse, not only on the house of Eli, but on the entirety of the Aaronic (priestly) line of Israel.  (1Sa 2:31, which reads, “The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your father’s house…”).  It seems as if the actions of the sons of Eli were indicative of a larger problem that was possibly widespread across Israel at that time – namely, priests using their position as mediator between God and man, to their own advantage.</p>

    <p>It also is interesting to note here that God first restates His promise to commit to the Aaron line of priests – “I promised that your house and your father’s house would minister before me forever.”  But then says, “Far be it from me!  Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained.”  </p>    
    

    <p>This is where the prophet Samuel is given his mandate (essentially).  Where Eli and his sons failed to serve the Lord properly, Samuel will step up and step into the shoes of the prophet of Israel and true servant of God that will be needed in the coming years as Israel transitions from their dark ages, into the period of the monarchy.</p>

    <p>Chapter 3 confirms this fact when the Lord calls to Samuel one night and gives him a vision directly.  See 1Sa 3:1-14.  A few interesting notes are important to mention here:  </p>
    
    <ol>
        
        <li>The chapter begins with the statement, “In those days the word of the Lord was rare; there were not many visions.”  According to the footnotes, during the entire period of the judges, apart from the prophet of 2:27-36, we are told of only two prophets (Jdg 4:4; 6:8) and of five revelations (Jdg 2:1-3; 6:11-26; 7:2-11; 10:11-14; 13:3-21).</li>
        
        <li>When Samuel is being called by the Lord at night, he (Samuel) believes he is being called by Eli, who was sleeping nearby.  The Lord calls Samuel four times.  The first three times, Samuel thought he was being called by Eli and ran to him by his bedside.  Eli, realizing it was the Lord calling Samuel, told him to go back and lie down and if the Lord calls him again, to answer.  In between the second and third calls, the author mentions that “Samuel did not yet know the Lord: The word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him.”  1Sa 3:7.  And, upon the fourth call, in which Samuel answers the Lord (rather than Eli), the author states, “The Lord came and stood there, calling as at the other times, ‘Samuel! Samuel!’” 1Sa 3:10.  Then, the Lord revealed to Samuel that Eli’s house was about to be destroyed and that the Lord would keep his promise he made to bring down the house of Eli for the sins of his sons. </li>
        
        <li>Samuel told Eli the message he received, and Eli responded, “He is the Lord; let him do what is good in his eyes.”  This tells me that despite the sons of Eli being wicked, Eli himself was a good man.</li>
        
        <li>From this point on, “all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the Lord.  The Lord continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word.”  1Sa 3:19-21.</li>
    
    </ol>

    <p>So, in Chapter 3 we come full circle.  From a time and place when the Lord’s revelations were not prevalent in the corporate life of Israel, to a time and place that begins to awaken to a new dawn that is on the horizon, led by Samuel, who will be a steadfast prophet for God in the coming days, taking Israel out of the dark period in their history, and leading them into the light of salvation that is promised by their God (to defeat Israel’s enemies and unite the tribes into a kingdom in the promised land…this was probably their “hope” in these days??).</p>
  
    
    <hr>

    <h4>1 Samuel 4, 5, 6</h4>

    <p>Something interesting happens in Chapter 4.  After the statement, “And Samuel’s word came to all Israel” (1Sa 4:1), we then read about the Ark of the Covenant being capture by Israel’s mortal enemies, the Philistines.</p>

    <p>After losing the first battle (at least in Chapter 4), the Israeli elders went back to the camp and decided to send word to Shiloh (the battle was between Ebenezer and Aphek) to bring the Ark to the battlefield, in order to give them the victory against the Philistines.  1Sa 4:3.  </p>

    <p>The Ark was retrieved from Shiloh and brought to the battlefield, along with Eli’s sons, Hophni and Phinehas, who were already destined to be punished for their crimes against God.  In battle the next day, the Philistines slaughtered the Israelites, captured the Ark and killed Hophni and Phinehas, thus proving that God can use non-believers to accomplish His Will whenever necessary.  The fact is that Eli and Samuel were given the same vision that Eli’s sons were doomed.  This was the sign that God was still involved in their lives.  This also served as a sign to the Israelites that the dwelling place of God was not to be treated as some kind of “good luck” talisman with “magical power”…rather it was to be revered as the dwelling place of God and treated accordingly.  See FN to 6:19 in NIV Study Bible.</p>

    <p>When Eli was brought news of his sons dying in the battle, and the ark being captured, he too died (from shock, falling back in his chair and breaking his neck; the Bible says he was “an old man and heavy.  He had led Israel forty years.” 1Sa 4:18).</p>
    

    <p>In Chapter 5, the Ark is carried to 3 different cities of the Philistines – Ashdod, Gath, Ekron.  In each case, “The Lord’s hand was heavy upon the people of Ashdod [also, with Gath and Ekron] and its vicinity; he brought devastation upon them and afflicted them with tumors.”  1Sa 5:6.  In each case, the people of those towns pleaded for the Ark to be removed from their city because of the destruction it was bringing upon them.</p>

    <p>At the outset of Chapter 6, “[w]hen the ark of the Lord had been in Philistine territory seven months, the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, ‘What shall we do with the ark of the Lord?  Tell us how we should send it back to its place.’  They answered, ‘If you return the ark of the god of Israel, do not send it away empty, but by all means send a guilt offering to him.  Then you will be healed, and you will know why his hand has not been lifted from you.”  1Sa 6:1 – 4.</p>

    <p>The Philistines did according to what their priests and diviners had said, and the omen showed them it was in fact the hand of the Lord that had dealt them the plagues.  See 1Sa 6:10 – 12.  The Ark wound up in. Beth Shemesh (just west of Jerusalem) and the people their rejoiced at its sight, made sacrifices for the Lord there and placed the sacrifices of the Philistines and the Ark on a large rock as a witness in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.  1Sa 6:18.  </p>

    <p>However, one important note – the Lord struck down 70 Israelites who had looked into the Ark and the people of Beth Shemesh were afraid and called over to the people of Kiriath Jearim to come and pick up the Ark from their village.  1Sa 6:21.  Again, this was a lesson to all those who were treating the Ark as some kind of “thing” to be admired in curiosity, rather than to be revered as the Holy Place of God.  Interestingly, the people of Beth Shemesh essentially respond to the Ark coming to their village in the same way as the pagan Philistines!</p>
    
    <hr>

    <h4>1 Samuel 7, 8, 9</h4>

    <p>Chapter 7 gives us an overview of Samuel’s role in Israel throughout his lifetime.  It also tells us that the Ark remained in Kiriath Jearim for the next 20 years under the watch of Adinadab’s son Eleazar, who must have been a faithful servant of the Lord in those days.</p>

    <p>Samuel’s first act as Israel’s “chief judge” (if we can give him a political title based on the text) was to tell Israel to get rid of their idols – “And Samuel said to the whole house of Israel, ‘If you are returning to the Lord with all your hearts, then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths and commit yourselves to the Lord and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.’  So the Israelites put away their Baals and Ashtoreths, and served the Lord only.”  1Sa 7:3 – 4.</p>

    <p>Samuel then assembled all of Israel at Mizpah and the people:  (1) drew water and poured it out before the Lord; (2) fasted, and (3) confessed “We have sinned against the Lord.”  1Sa 7:6.</p>

    <p>Samuel also interceded on behalf of Israel against the surrounding enemies – “So the Philistines were subdued and did not invade Israelite territory again.” 1Sa 7:13.  “And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.” 1Sa 7:14.  Israel also recaptured towns in modern-day Gaza – “The towns from Ekron to Gath…”</p>
    
    <p>Finally, “Samuel continued as judge over Israel all the days of his life.  From year to year he went on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah, judging Israel in all those places.  But he always went back to Ramah, where his home was and there he also judged Israel.  And he built an alter there to the Lord.”  1Sa 7:15 – 17.</p>

    <p>In Chapter 8, we see that Samuel is in his old age and has two sons – Joel and Abijah – who were appointed judges in Beersheba.  However, they did not walk in his ways, which prompted the leaders of Israel to beg Samuel to anoint a King over them.  Samuel consults the Lord, and the Lord says: “Listen to all that the people are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me as their king.  As they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are doing to you.”  1Sa 8:7-8.</p>

    <p>Samuel tells the people that if they have a King, he will essentially enslave them – take their young men off to war, their young women for his palace, take their best crops and land for his purposes, etc.  The people ignore the warning and tell Samuel to move forward with finding a king for them.  1Sa 8:19 (“But the people refused to listen…”).</p>

    <p>In Chapter 9, we are introduced to Saul, son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who is searching for his father’s lost donkey’s in the land.  Compare the fact Saul is introduces as a donkey wrangler with David who is introduced as a shepherd.</p>
    
    <p>Samuel (we are told later) is in Ramah and is about to hold a sacrifice and banquet at the “high place” in town for the people.  Interestingly, the term “high place” was from after the entrance into the promised land, the Israelites often followed the custom of the Canaanites in building local alters on hills.  At this time the central sanctuary was not functioning because the ark of God was separated from the tabernacle; Shiloh had been destroyed (when?) and the priestly family, after the death of Eli’s sons, was apparently still inactive.  In later times, worship at these high places provided a means for the entrance of pagan practices into Israel’s religious observances and for this reason it was condemned (see not on 1 Ki 3:2).</p>

    <p>Samuel, who was simply called “the seer” (which was synonymous with the idea of “prophet” but it seems as if the word “prophet” was not entered into their vocabulary or vernacular speech at that time?  See 1Sa 9:9), had been given a Word from God that Saul would be coming into town and that Saul was the one to anoint as the next King of Israel:  “About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin.  Anoint him leader over my people Israel; he will deliver my people from the hand of the Philistines.  I have looked upon my people, for their cry has reached me.”  1Sa 9:16.</p>  
    
    
    <hr>

    <h4>1 Samuel 10, 11, 12</h4>

    <p>Samuel sends Saul on his way after anointing him and tells him of 3 signs that will occur on his way home to let Saul know that God has chosen him to be the next King of Israel – (1) he will find a man waiting for him along the way with his father’s donkeys; (2) he will find three men ‘going up to God at Bethel’ who will offer him 2 loaves of break; (3) he will find a ‘procession of prophets coming down from the high place’ in his hometown of Gibeah and “The Spirit of the Lord will come upon you in power and you will prophesy with them; and you will be changed into a different person.  Once these signs are fulfilled, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God is with you.”  1Sa 10:6 – 7.</p>

    <p>Interestingly, this passage talks about bands of “prophets” that were banded together across the region apparently along with Samuel.  See also the “sons of prophets” with whom Elijah and Elisha were associated in 1 Ki 20:35.</p>

    <p>Samuel then called all the tribes of Israel together at Mizpah and made the announcement that Saul was chosen to be their king.  1Sam 10:20 – 24.</p>

    <p>In Chapter 11, the Ammonites (descendants of Lot [see Ge 19:36 – 38 and notes; Dt 2:19]) who lived east of the Jordan river saw an opportunity to attack Israel in the wake of their fighting with the Philistines to the west.  Saul hears of it and calls all the surrounding area fighters to him and leads Israel into victory over the Ammonites.  Israel as a whole confirms him as King after this.  See 1Sa 11:12 – 15.  </p>
    
    <p>Interestingly at this point, Saul gives credit to the Lord for the victory (see 1Sa 11:13).</p>

    <p>In Chapter 12, Samuel gathers the people of Israel and warns them of the danger that lies ahead in their rejecting God as their king in favor of a man (Saul).  Samuel is old and about to die and he viewed Israel’s request for a human king was a covenant-breaking act on the part of the people (which covenant – Abrahamic?, Mosiac?).  Samuel summarizes the evidence against them, including the nasty cycle the people had fallen into during the period of the judges – apostasy, divine chastening, urgent appeals to God and divine restoration.</p>

    <p>Samuel warns the people and the new king (Saul):  “If you fear the Lord and serve and obey him and do not rebel against his commands and if both you and the king who reigns over you follow the Lord your God – good!  But if you do not obey the Lord, and if you rebel against his commands, his hand will be against you, as it was against your fathers.”  1Sa 12:14 – 15.</p>

    <p>Here Samuel is relating the covenant conditions to the new era of the monarchy. See Ex. 19:5-6; Dt 8:19; 11:13-15, 22-23; 28:1, 15; 30:17-18; Jos 24:20.</p>  
    
    <p>After some display of natural wonder (thunder and lightning and heavy rains during dry season, after Samuel prays), the people ask Samuel to pray for them, to which Samuel responds: “Do not be afraid…You have done all this evil; yet do not turn away from the Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart.  Do not turn away after useless idols.  They can do you no good, nor can they rescue you, because they are useless.  For the sake of his great name the Lord will not reject his people, because the Lord was pleased to make you his own…But be sure to fear the Lord and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you.  Yet if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will be swept away.”  1Sa 12:20 – 25.</p>

    <h4>1 Samuel 13, 14, 15</h4>

    <p>Chapter 13 has a story about Saul, waiting to attack the Philistines and waiting on Samuel to arrive at Gilgal.  “Saul remained at Gilgal, and all the troops with him were quaking with fear.  He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and Saul’s men began to scatter.”  1Sa 13:7 – 8.</p>

    <p>Here, Saul does a reasonable thing, in my mind, and he offers up the fellowship offering and the burnt offering, to bring God’s favor upon His army before going into battle.  However, Samuel arrives and speaking about the sacrifice Saul had made to God, says, “You acted foolishly….You have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.  But now your kingdom will not endure; the Lord as sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him leader of his people, because you have not kept the Lord’s command.”  1Sa 13:13 – 14.</p>

    <p>This is the reason behind why Saul is replaced by David in the eyes of God?</p>

    <p>One interesting side note in Chapter 13 is that the Philistine’s had a monopoly on the technology of iron production at this time.  See 1Sa 13:19 (“Not a blacksmith could be found…”).  This must have severely hampered agricultural and war-making capabilities.</p>
    
    <p>In Chapter 14, we read several more key mistakes made in the character flaw of Saul:</p>
    
    <ul>
    
        <li>First, Saul brought the ark of God to his camp to have the priest inquire of God about the battle with the Philistines.  1Sa 14:18.  However, when Saul learns he has the military advantage, but before the priest has gotten a message from God, “Saul said to the priest, ‘Withdraw your hand.’  1Sa 14:19b.  This meant that Saul commanded the priest stop his action.  Due to the urgency of the moment, Saul decides that to wait for the word of the Lord might jeopardize his military advantage.  As in chapter 13:8 – 12 [when he made the sacrifice], his decision rests on his own insight rather than on dependence upon the Lord and a commitment to obey him.  [NIV Note].</li>
        
        <li>Next, we read that Jonathan took on a Philistine outpost, with only one other soldier by his side, and he returns to Saul’s camp as a minor hero for his victory against the enemy.  1Sa 14:1.  Upon his return to the camp, he was unaware that King Saul had made a declaration/oath/curse staying, “Cursed be any man who eats food before evening comes, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!”  1Sa 14:24.  Jonathan then is marching through the woods with the rest of the Army and he tastes honey that is found in the wild.  1Sa 14:27 – 28.  “Jonathan said, ‘My father has made trouble for the country.” 1Sa 14:29.  </li>
        
        <li>Saul then later inquires of the Lord (whether to destroy the Philistines) but receives no answer.  This prompts him to gather the Army to see “what sin has been committed today.  As surely as the Lord who rescues Israel lives, even if it lies with my son Jonathan, he must die.”  1Sa 14:38 – 39.  By drawing lots, Saul finds out that Jonathan is the sinner in the group.  However, the men speak up for Jonathan and Saul does not kill him, thus breaking another oath to the Lord upon which he foolishly made (to kill his own son).  1Sa 14:45.  </li>
    
    </ul>
    
    <p>Chapter 15 indicates (specifically) that the Lord rejects Saul as king over Israel.  In 1Sa 15:1-3, we read that the Lord sends a message, through Samuel, for Saul to go and kill all of the Amalekites – all men, women, children and livestock.  Saul disobeys the command by saving the king – Agag – along with the best livestock of the Amalekites as plunder for him and his men.  Saul justifies this action by saying he is going to sacrifice the best animal as an offering to God (in spite of disobeying the command of the Lord, e.g., the Lord desires OBEDIENCE rather than SACRIFICE).</p>

    <p>Samuel receives word of this disobedience from the Lord and visits Saul.  Saul argues with Samuel that he did in fact obey the Lord (except for the ‘kill all of them’ part), but Samuel tells Saul what God has ordained, “Does the Lord delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the Lord?  To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams.  For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry.  Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, he has rejected you as king.”  1Sa 15:22 – 23.</p>

    <p>Samuel then kills Agag himself “before the Lord at Gilgal.”  1Sa 15:33.  Sadly, Samuel leaves for his hometown and “Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for him.  And the Lord was grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel.”  1Sa 15:35.</p>

    <h4>1 Samuel 16, 17, 18</h4>

    <p>According to the comments in the NIV, the anointing of David takes place c. 1025 BC.  </p>

    <p>In chapter 16 a few key things stand out, namely:  (1) the Lord’s choice of David to be the next anointed King was based on his heart, not his appearance.  In rejecting David’s older brothers, the Lord says to Samuel, “Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him.  The Lord does not look at the things man looks at.  Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.”  1 Sa 16:7; (2) Samuel anoints David (1 Sa 16:13) in front of his family, “and from that day on the Spirit of the Lord came upon David in power.”; (3) at the same time, “Now the Spirit of the Lord had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord tormented him.”  1 Sa 16:14.</p>

    <p>The last point is interesting and the NIV note says, evil spirits are subject to God’s control and operate only within divinely determined boundaries (see 1 Ki 22:19-23; Job 1:12; 2:6; 2 Sa 24:1).  The spirit that now tormented Saul (for his disobedience) leads to Saul’s increasing tendencies of despondency, jealousy and violence.  In a twist of divine fate, David is summoned by Saul because he (David) is well known for playing the harp, which Saul now requires to soothe his soul because of the evil spirit that now torments him.  No doubt the Spirit of God was guiding David’s music as well.</p>

    <p>Chapter 17 is the famous story of David and Goliath.  Israel and the Philistines were gathered for war and Goliath was the “champion” of the Philistines.  In these days, one way to settle a war was to have 1 man from each side come out to fight.  Whoever won, their side would win the war.  It was thought to be ordained by the gods that they worshipped as to whoever won (similar to “trial by ordeal” of the middle ages).</p>
    
    <p>The Bible tells us that for “For forty days the Philistine [Goliath] came forward every morning and evening and took his stand” (17:16) calling for a fight against a sole warrior of Israel.  The Bible says, “On hearing the Philistine’s words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified.”  17:11.  But, when David arrives, he says, “Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?” 17:26.</p>

    <p>Here, we see the difference between Saul and David.  Saul, who has at this point, lost the spirit of God in his life, is afraid and does not trust on the promises of God that Israel will possess the promised land.  David, on the other hand, who has the Spirit of God with him, is completely unafraid of this “uncircumcised” pagan and is willing to risk his life in battle to prove his faith.  David defeats the giant Philistine with his sling and stone and cuts off his head and takes his armor.  Israel then routes the Philistine army.</p>

    <p>In Chapter 18, we see the rise of David in the ranks of Saul’s Army (promoted by Saul himself) and the friendship of Jonathan and David grows stronger and bonded in spirit.  We also read that upon returning from the battle with the Philistines, the women sang songs for the men, which included one that said, “Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands.”  18:7.</p>

    <p>It is with these song lyrics that Saul begins to take note of how the people love David and we learn that “Saul was very angry; this [song] refrain galled him.”  18:8.  “And from that time on Saul kept a jealous eye on David.”  18:9.  </p>    
    
    <p>So, we see that some of the tell-tale signs of someone who has lost God’s favor start to show up in Saul’s life at this point – (1) anger; (2) jealousy.</p>

    <p>After long, the Bible tells us Saul adds another one to the list – (3) fear.  “Saul was afraid of David, because the Lord was with David but had left Saul.  So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men, and David led the troops in their campaigns.  IN everything he did he had great success, because the Lord was with him.”  18:12 – 14.</p>

    <p>Saul then double-crosses David.  As one of the promises Saul made to his Army was that whomever killed Goliath would get his oldest daughter in marriage, David was entitled to that marriage.  However, after David killed Goliath, Saul adds more conditions on the marriage proposal, by telling David that he needed to fight for him (Saul) in his army.  Here, Saul was hoping that David would be killed in battle by the Philistines because he himself knew the Lord was with David and did not want to lift a finger against him.  At the last minute, Saul marries his older daughter to someone else (Adriel of Meholah).  Saul eventually marries off his other daughter Michal (who the Bible says “was in love with David” 18:20).  In doing this, Saul was trying to bring David down (although it does not specifically say how, why? Was it because the girl was crazy? Lol.).  He says, “I will give her [Michal] to him, so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.”  18:21.</p>

    <p>From this point on, David has success upon success against the Philistine’s in battle and “Saul became still more afraid of him, and he remained his enemy the rest of his days.” 18:29.</p>    
    
    <hr>

    <h4>1 Samuel 19, 20, 21</h4>

    <p>Chapter 19 is an interesting chapter because we see the open rebellion and sinful heart of Saul against God’s plan for not only David, but for all of Israel, which comes to light in this chapter.  </p>

    <p>Saul’s jealousy over David’s anointing and favor from God culminates in him no longer hiding his intent to kill David.  Saul tells his sons that they are to go and find David and kill him.  Jonathan, Saul’s son and David’s loyal friend, convinces Saul to not kill David because (1) he has never wronged Saul, (2) everything David does benefits Saul, and (3) if Saul killed David, he would be killing an innocent man for no reason.  “Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath:  ‘As surely as the Lord lives, David will not be put to death.’”  19:6.</p>

    <p>After Saul sends David out to fight another battle for him against the Philistines (which David wins), Saul, possessed by an evil spirit while David was playing the harp for him, once again starts plotting to kill David.  This time, Michal, Saul’s daughter and David’s wife, helps him escape in the middle of the night.  David flees to Ramah to find Samuel, who takes David to a village called Naioth (means “dwellings” or “habitations”), which was situated in or near Ramah and is where a complex of houses where a company of prophets lived.  Saul finds out where David was hiding and sends several waves of his soldiers to go capture him.  “But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit of God came upon Saul’s men and they also prophesied.”  19:20.</p>

    <p>Saul sends another wave of men to which the same thing happens, and he ultimately goes to find David himself in Ramah.  When Saul arrives there, “the Spirit of God came even upon him, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth.  He stripped off his robes and also prophesied in Samuel’s presence.  He lay that way all that day and night.”  19:23 – 24.  </p>
    
    
    <p>It is interesting to note here that Saul is being manipulated in this story by the “spirit” world.  The chapter tells us that, after reconciling with David (after making an oath to Jonathan), he breaks that oath shortly thereafter when “an evil spirit from the Lord came upon Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand.  While David was playing the harp, Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear…” 19:9 – 10.  I wonder if the Lord had not sent this spirit to overcome Saul, would he have tried to kill David?  Furthermore, the chapter ends with Saul having a plan to go kill David, but is overtaken by “the Spirit of God” and spends the next day laying and prophesying rather than plotting and scheming to kill David. </p>

    <p>In 19:9, we read (in the NIV) that it is an “evil spirit from the Lord”.  The biblehub translation website, translates the phrase, “distressing spirit from Yahweh” or “rā-‘āh rū-aḥ Yah-weh” with the first word being the adjective “evil”.  The key word here then becomes “evil” or “distressing” which is from the Hebrew word [ra’].  It is concordance word 7451 and means (directly) “adversity.”  It is an adjective and is defined as “bad, evil.”  It is the same word used in Genesis 2:9 to describe “the knowledge of good and evil.”  Interestingly, “Ra” was the god of the Egyptians.</p>

    <p>In 19:23, we read that “the Spirit of God” next came upon Saul.  The Biblehub translation translates the phrase the same as above essentially and is made up of the Hebrew phrase from two words, “rū-aḥ Elohim”.  rū-aḥ is concordance number 7307 and is pronounced and defined (directly) as ruach: breath, wind, spirit.  It is a noun.</p>

    <p>In chapter 20 we read about an important oath between Jonathan (son of Saul) and David.  They devise a plan to discover whether Saul was truly after David to kill him and it works out that Saul reveals his intentions to kill David.  20:31.  The chapter ends with Jonathan and David reaffirming their oath to the Lord and to each other.  Interestingly, in this chapter, David and Jonathan make up a lie to deceive Saul (who is after David) in order to allow David time to flee from the evil that Saul is inflicting on David’s life.  This is interesting because David is anointed by the Lord and yet still makes up a “lie” about him not going to the New Moon festival and to allow him time to escape Saul.  I wonder if there are any negative consequences down stream about this particular “sin” that David commits?</p>
    
    <p>In Chapter 21, David escapes the moment and flees to Nob (a town NE of Jerusalem) to seek out the priest at the tabernacle there.  The commentary notes indicate that even though the tabernacle was at Nob (taken there after its destruction at Shiloh, See 4:3; Jer 7:12), the ark of the covenant was not taken there (see note on 7:1).  Nonetheless, the High Priest (Ahmelech) and 85 other priests, along with the consecrated bread and the ephod.  David’s purpose in going to Nob was to seek the Lord’s guidance by means of the Urim and Thummim (see notes 2:28; Ex 28:30).</p>

    <p>Ahimelech asks David why he has come to Nob and David once again deceives the priest and tells him a story about how Saul sent him out alone on a secret mission.  David’s purpose in lying here appears to be to load up on bread and weapons without arousing suspicion of his escape.  The high priest agrees to give him the consecrated bread (where he asks David if he and his men are ceremonially clean and David replies they are) and also the only sword in the town, which was the sword of Goliath, whom David killed. </p>

    <p>David then goes and flees to “Achish king of Gath” (Philistine territory) whereby he commits another deception to save himself.  David became aware of the Philistines knowledge of who he was and thought they may kill him, so David pretended to be a madman in their presence, “making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard.”  21:13.</p>

    <hr>

    <h4>1 Samuel 22, 23, 24</h4>

    <p>In Chapter 22, David’s family, friends and a group of 400 “outlaws” band together in the desert, including the prophet Gad, and later the priest Abiathar (son of Ahimelech).</p>

    <p>Saul finds out the priests of Nob, which was the town of the Lord’s priests and prophets, helped David on the run (see Ch. 21) and he summons them all to come to him.  After questioning Ahimelech, who tells him he had no idea of what was going on, Saul orders his own men to kill all the priests of the Lord.  They refuse, however, there is a man, Doeg the Edomite, who was in Nob when Ahimelech helped David, and he puts them all to the sword.  Abiathar, son of Ahimelech, escapes and flees to join David in the desert.</p>

    <p>Interestingly, the slaughter of all the priests at Nob fulfills the prophecy of judgment against the house of Eli from 1 Sam 2:31.</p>

    <p>In Chapter 23, David inquires of the Lord using the Ephod about helping the town of Keilah defend itself against the attacks of the Philistines.  The Lord gives David a victory and Saul finds out and comes down to attack him.  Interestingly, while in pursuit and closing in on David, Saul learns the Philistines are attacking his lands and so he breaks off the hunt for David to go defend against the Philistines.</p>
    
    <p>In Chapter 24, David, hiding in caves, sneaks up on Saul in the cave and cuts a piece of his robe off.  At this time, David uses this to show Saul that he could have taken his life but spared it because David is an honorable man who says he will not strike down the Lord’s anointed.  David makes a risky play here and leaves the cave to confront Saul.  David’s men try to convince David to kill Saul, but David passes this test from the Lord, and he does what is pleasing to the Lord, over what is pleasing to men.  In being confronted by David and learning that David could have taken his life but did not, Saul “wept aloud” and said, “You are more righteous than I.”  </p>

    <p>Saul makes David swear an oath that he will not “cut off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father’s family.”  (24:21).  Interestingly, Saul returns home and David went back to his stronghold in the desert.  David passes this test from the Lord and shows his submission to the Lord’s will in his life.</p>

    <hr>

    <h4>1 Samuel 25, 26, 27</h4>

    <p>Chapter 25 shows a great picture of a servant of the Lord in the woman of Abigail.  David’s men send word to Abigail’s husband, Nabal, that they need food and provisions.  David and his men previously protected Nabal’s sheep and shepherds and thought he would be amenable to helping them.  He was not and rejected the messengers outright that David sent to him.  David then roused his men for battle and on their way to go slaughter the entire town, Abigail came to meet him with food and provisions and apologized.  Abigail made some important statements demonstrating her sincere service to the Lord.  In verse 30, she highlights the fact that for David to kill Nabal and the village that he (David) would have needless blood on his hand AND also that he would have the conscious of having “avenged himself.” </p>

    <p>Importantly, as Christians, we are to let God be our avenger.  This principle is played out in this Chapter.  David agrees to accept Abigail’s provisions in lieu of killing Nabal and his town and thanks Abigail for saving him from avenging himself.  “About ten days later, the Lord struck Nabal and he died.”  (25:38).  It is important to understand that God does not act unless we obey Him.  Here David, by the quick actions of Abigail, did not avenge himself and thus allowed the Lord to fulfill His promise that He will avenge us.</p>

    <p>Abigail then shows herself to be a true woman of God when David send for her hand in marriage and she accepts by saying, “Here is your maidservant, ready to serve you and wash the feet of my master’s servants.”  (25:41).</p>

    <p>In Chapter 26, David sneaks into Saul’s army encampment and steals a water jug and spear that are near Saul while he is sleeping.  The man with David, Abishai, sought to kill Saul, but David stops him, saying that he is forbidden to lay a hand on the anointed man of God.  David predicts Saul must die by the Lord’s hand – in battle or otherwise – and that David is not allowed to take Saul’s life because God has not commanded him to do so.</p>
    
    <p>Here again, David proves to be a faithful servant of the Lord in his dealings with Saul.</p>
    
    <p>Chapter 27, David realizes Saul will continue to pursue him so he decides to flee to the land of the Philistines.  He is given a settlement in Ziklag for him and his men by Achish, the son of Maoch, King of Gath.  Interestingly, David does not leave Ziklag until after the death of Saul.  David does use deception here against the Philistines where he tells the king that he is raiding Israelite settlements in the Nagev with his men, but in reality, he is going and raiding the Geshurites, Girzites and Amalekites.  Thus, this brought favor on David and earned the trust of the king (by deception).</p>
    
    <hr>

    <h4>1 Samuel 28, 29, 30</h4>

    <p>In Chapter 28, Saul consults the witch of Endor.  It is important to note that Saul previously expelled all mediums and spiritualists from Israel.  However, Saul is about to go into battle with a large Philistine force and the Lord does not respond to his calls and is not communicating with Saul through dreams or visions any longer.</p>

    <p>Saul consults the witch and she brings up Samuel who tells Saul that he (Saul) and his sons will be with Samuel (i.e., dead) after this upcoming battle.  This seals Saul’s doom and he is distraught after hearing it.</p>

    <p>Chapter 29 is an interesting exchange between David and Achish, King of Philistia.  The commanders of the Army did not want to fight next to David for fear that he would turn against him to support Israel during the battle.  So, while Achish professes to trust David wholeheartedly, the nobles and commanders of the Army did not.  So, David is told to turn back and does not fight with the Philistines against Saul and Israel.</p>

    <p>In Chapter 30, upon arriving back at Ziklag, David finds the town destroyed by the Amalekites.  David’s wives were captured in the raid as well.  The men began to talk against David and wanted to stone him because they lost their wives and children and cattle and possessions.  “But David found strength in the Lord his God.” (v. 30:6).</p>
    
    <p>David inquired of the Lord first before pursuing the Amalekite raiders and finally caught up to them and was able to get his stuff and his wives back and recovered everyone’s wives and children and livestock.  Upon returning to his own camp, trouble makers started stirring up trouble about how to divvy up the possessions (plunder) they got from the Amalekites.  The trouble makers wanted to only give to those who went with them to fight, but David says the plunder is for all and that “the share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle.”  (v. 30:24).  David made this principle into a law (statute).</p>
    
    <p>David also sends out gifts to the surrounding villages of Judah to begin the process of securing allies for his eventual kingship.</p>
    
    <hr>

    <h4>1 Samuel 31</h4>

    <p>The death of Saul.  While David was taking care of his own problems, Saul fought the Philistines in battle.  The Philistines first killed the sons of Saul, including Jonathan, and then Saul.  In reality, Saul took his own life by falling on his sword before the Philistines could get to him, on Mount Gilboa.</p>

    <p>The Philistines then cut off his head and paraded his armor in their temples.  They even hung his body on the wall at Beth Sh’an. (v. 31:10).</p>

    <p>The Philistines then occupied the land of Israel for some time after.</p>

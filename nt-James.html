  <h1>New Testament Commentary</h1>

    <h2>The Book of James</h2>
    
<h4>Introduction, Chapter 1</h4>

<p>The letter of James has several characteristics such as (1) its unmistakable intent to be written for a Jewish audience; (2) its emphasis on vital Christianity, characterized by good deeds and a faith that works (genuine faith must and will be accompanied by a consistent lifestyle); (3) its simple organization; (4) its familiarity with Jesus’ teachings preserved in the Sermon on the Mount; (5) its similarity to OT Proverbs; (6) its excellent Greek.</p>

<p>James’ letter begins with the idea of “testing” one’s faith through trials.  It should lead to a mature faith built on a strong foundation.  Those who seek God without faith that he actually will do what he has promised to do, do so to their own peril.  James says, “That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does.”  (1:7 – 8).  Therefore, faith is the cornerstone of truly seeking and believing in God and one cannot receive the blessings from God without it.</p>

<p>The trials we face come through temptation.  But, temptations do not come from an external sources (e.g., God), rather “...each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed.  Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.” (1:14 – 15).</p>

<p>Then, in probably the most succinct, but complex part of Christian theology, as to the dialectic nature between faith and works, or between listening and doing the word, James tells us: “DO NOT MERELY LISTEN TO THE WORD, AND SO DECEIVE YOURSELVES. DO WHAT IT SAYS.” (1:22, my emphasis added).  Jesus says in Matthew 7:21, “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.”  Jesus, in John 14:15, tells us, “If you love me, you will obey what I command.”  And, in John 14:23 – 24 He says, “If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching.  My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.  He who does not love me will not obey my teaching.  These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.”</p>

<p>Jesus taught about the Vine and the Branches which speaks to the same.  In John 15:1 – 17, Jesus tells his disciples, “If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father’s commands and remain in his love...My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you...You are my friends if you do what I command...This is my command: Love each other.”  So, what is Jesus telling us, both in John and through the letter of James?  That we must obey his command to love each other as He loves us, which was exemplified in the fact that “Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.” (John 15:13).  </p>

<p>Must we be willing to die then to bring the Gospel message to others?  And even if so, would our intentions be pure in that we are “willing” to go out of love for the lost, rather than on some glory-hound mission to impress God?  The solution to this problem can also be found in John 15:7 – 8: “If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you.  This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.”  So, if we are abiding in the word of our Lord Jesus, and we ask for pure intentions in our “willingness” to go out and preach the Gospel to the lost, despite the risks to our own life and reputation, we can trust that God will purify our intentions about it when we ask Him.</p>

<p>So, James gives us some practical advice: “Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, for man’s anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.  Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you.” (1:19 – 21).  James closes out chapter 1 with the following, “If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless.  Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.”</p>

<h4>James 2, 3</h4>

<p>In chapter 2 James asks rhetorically, “What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds?” (2:14).  Using a great analogy of the difference between “wishing” someone in need well and “acting out” to make them well in their time of need, James concludes, “In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.” (2:17).</p>

<p>Faith, in and of itself, must be demonstrated, in order to be a credit to us.  “Even the demons believe” that there is only one God (2:19).  But are the demons saved also?  Sure not!  “Was not Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the alter?” (2:21).  “His faith was made complete by what he did.” (2:22).  Therefore, “A person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.” (2:24).</p>

<p>In chapter 3, James is making a distinction between a “wise” man and a fool.  The tongue of a man is like the rudder on a ship (3:4).  It is a small part on a larger vessel that controls the whole course of the direction the ship goes.  James goes so far as to say, “The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.” (3:6).  “It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.” (3:8b).  “With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God’s likeness.  Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing.  My brothers, this should not be.” (3:9 – 10).</p>

<p>Therefore, James cautions those who claim to be wise and understanding as believers: “Who is wise and understanding among you?  Let him show it by his good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.” (3:13).  There are those who may be intelligent, but are lacking in true wisdom: “But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth. Such ‘wisdom’ does not come down from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, of the devil.  For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice.” (3:14 – 16).</p>

<p>“But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.  Peacemakers who sow I peace raise a harvest of righteousness.” (3:17 – 18).  Proverbs tells us that the “beginning of wisdom” is a fear of the Lord. (CITE).  Therefore, to begin on the path of wisdom, one must reverently seek the Lord, with a healthy fear that His promises are made true through His actions, and in so doing, you will find that God’s wisdom is good and unselfish, caring for others above oneself, and in direct competition with the heart’s desire to be bitter, envious and selfish.  God’s love is an outward spreading love and is manifested in actions and deeds poured out on others out of mercy and compassion.</p>

<h4>James 4</h4>

<p>Here is some practical advice from James in chapter 4:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>The thing that causes fights and quarrels among men comes from the worldly desires within each of us.  We want something but we can’t have it, so we fight for it, causing strife in the world through our desire.  (4:1-2).</li>
    <li>But you should know that “friendship” with the world’s ways demonstrate a hatred toward God’s Ways.  “Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.” (4:4b).</li>
    <li>As for the things you desire, “You do not have, because you do not ask God.  When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.” (4:2c – 3).</li>
    <li>You must “submit” yourself to God.  “Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.  Come near to God and he will come near to you.” (4:7-8).</li>
    <li>To “submit” oneself to God we must change our hearts from desiring earthly things to having a longing in our hearts for God: “Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.” (4:8b – 10).</li>
    <li>As to “submitting” oneself to God in regards to thy neighbor who lives in the world, “do not slander one another.  Anyone who speaks against his brother or judges him speaks against the law...[and]...who are you to judge your neighbor?” (4:11 – 12).  “There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and destroy.” (4:12).</li>
    <li>As to submitting your plans for your life to God, since we cannot foretell what will happen tomorrow or even an hour from now, what profit is it to us if we brag and boast about our business plans for the future?  We are like a vapor that “appears for a little while and then vanishes.” (4:14).  “Instead, you ought to say, ‘If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that.’” (4:15).  “All [other] boasting is evil. Anyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn’t do it, sins.” (4:16-17)</li>
</ul>

    <h4>James 5</h4>

<p>Chapter 5 covers a lot of ground.  For the rich person, who feels self-sufficient and justified in doing evil based on his wealth, and does not call on the name of the Lord for sustenance, then that person is like a fattened cow on the day of the slaughter.  He will perish in the judgement to come for being a fool.  For the believer – do not grumble with each other and be patient on the Lord’s second coming.  We must persevere through all sorts of trials and tribulations so that the harvest is ready only when God deems it is ready...we are not the Judge on that matter. </p> 

<p>Do not swear – not by heaven and not by earth – let your yes be yes and no be no – otherwise you will be “condemned.”  Here, the meaning is that you should not flippantly use the name of the Lord in vain or to swear by anything.  If you are in trouble, you should pray.  If someone is sick, you should call the elders of the church to pray over him.  Church members should confess their sins to each other and pray for each other so that we all may be healed.  If you are happy, you should sing praises to God.</p>

    <p>James leaves us with the following faithful saying: “Whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save him from death and cover over a multitude of sins.” (5:20).</p>

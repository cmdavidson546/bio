    <h1>New Testament Commentary</h1>

    <h2>The Book of Acts</h2>

    <h4>Acts 8, 9, 10</h4>
    <p>I have been using this pandemic to get back into the Bible by reading 3 short chapters a day, every morning, from the New Testament. I will post the reading plan that I am following for anyone who wants to do it as well. Today I read Acts, Chapters 8, 9 and 10. These passages talk about Saul's conversion to become the Apostle Paul and Peter's realization that the Gospel was not meant for a small group of selected people...but rather it was meant for ALL who repent and believe in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>

    <p>Here are Peter's words upon such realization (Acts 10: 34-43):34 Then Peter began to speak: “I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism 35 but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right. 36 You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, announcing the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. 37 You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached— 38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.</p>

    <p>39 “We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross, 40 but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. 41 He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. 42 He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. 43 All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”</p>

    <h4>Acts 11, 12, 13</h4>

    <p>It always amazes me how similar the Roman empire is to the American one in many ways. We now live in a world that rejects Jesus as the answer to our problems. But, for those who have ears to hear, these passages demonstrate that no matter how depraved the world around us becomes - persecution (Acts 11:19), famine (Acts 11:28), corrupt rulers (Acts 12:1), putting the innocent to death for the sake of personal and political gain (Acts 12:2), false imprisonment (Acts 12:3), false teaching, psychics and "sorcery" (Acts 13:6), incitement of the masses to violence (Acts 13:50) - God's Will always prevails over the ways of this world.</p>

    <p>Here was Paul's sermon today in Acts 13:
    26 “Fellow children of Abraham and you God-fearing Gentiles, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent. 27 The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath. 28 Though they found no proper ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed. 29 When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb. 30 But God raised him from the dead, 31 and for many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to our people.</p>

    <p>32 “We tell you the good news: What God promised our ancestors 33 he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm:</p>

    <p>“‘You are my son;
        today I have become your father.'</p>

    <p>34 God raised him from the dead so that he will never be subject to decay....</p>

    <p>38 “Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. 39 Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a justification you were not able to obtain under the law of Moses. 40 Take care that what the prophets have said does not happen to you:</p>

    <p>41 “‘Look, you scoffers, wonder and perish, for I am going to do something in your days that you would never believe, even if someone told you.”</p>

    <h4>Acts 14, 15, 16</h4>

    <p>Imagine if you decided to go to the Middle East today to preach the message of Jesus Christ. How successful are you likely to be over there with that message? Having spent a total of 18 months of my own life living in the Middle East, I can tell you that it would be an extremely dangerous trip and that you would likely be killed promoting that particular message.</p>

    <p>Acts 14 begins the story of Paul, who did precisely that...he packed up his things and went overseas on a dangerous mission to a foreign land. The only difference is that he went as an Ambassador FOR Christ rather than on his own authority (See Acts 9). Paul went to areas of the world that were heavily saturated in polytheistic cult worship (every city had different cult practices and different gods) and who had never heard the name of Jesus.</p>

    <p>At first, a few hundred Greeks were converted on Paul's missions. Then those converts told everyone they knew, and a few thousand more were converted. Then millions of cult-worshipping polytheistic Greeks began to believe in Jesus Christ and His message of salvation to the world until the Roman Empire officially adopted Christianity as its official religion. The interesting thing is that Paul's mission was predicted to happen in the Old Testament many many years before it actually occured in real life history.</p>

    <p>Paul was told by Jesus to go to the Gentiles and he went...despite the fact that the mission looked impossible and he probably would be killed for it. He did the impossible through obedience to the Word of God. What could you accomplish if you obeyed God in your life today? And, how do you really and truly become "saved"?</p>

    <p>Good question...here's Paul's answer from Acts 16:30-34:</p>

    <p>"30 He [the prison guard] then brought them [Paul and companion] out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” 31 They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved — you and your household.” 32 Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house. 33 At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his household were baptized. 34 The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God—he and his whole household.</p>

    <h4>Acts 17, 18, 19</h4>
    <p>Paul travels all over the (Greek-speaking) world to share the Good News that belief in Christ results in a saving relationship with God. He travels to Thessalonica, Berea, Athens, Corinth, Syria, and Ephesus. Acts 17 provides a summary for his work: "2 As his custom was...[for] days he reasoned with them from Scriptures, 3 explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ...11 Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they receved the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true. 12 Many of [them] believed."</p>

    <h4>Acts 20, 21, 22</h4>
    <p>Paul is about to come home to Jerusalem to be put on trial.  His crime: promoting the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  Acts 20:21: "...they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus...35 In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'" Acts 22:16: "And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name."</p>

    <h4>Acts 23, 24, 25</h4>
    <p>The religious leaders from Jerusalem hired a local attorney to prosecute their case against Paul before the Roman governor in Judea. Even though the case was considered by the Romans to be a CIVIL trial the religious leaders from Jerusalem requested that Paul be put to death. Back then, as today, the death penalty should never be available as a remedy in civil court. The death penalty is reserved for criminal courts. These passages in Acts demonstrate the extent the prince of this world is willing to go to in order to pervert justice for his own agenda. We see this playing out even today. Those who are not with God, are against God. Those who do not fill their hearts with God's Truth and Justice are therefore exposed and available to be USED AS AGENTS of the evil one... however he sees fit to use you. Don't be used as an agent of evil...there is a better Way to live.</p>

    <p>Opening arguments and witnesses against Paul (Acts 24): 5 “We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect 6 and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him. [7] 8 By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him.” 9 The other Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true."</p>

    <p>Paul defends himself pro se (without an attorney) (Acts 24): 10 When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: “I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defense. 11 You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship. 12 My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city. 13 And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me. 14 However, I admit that I worship the God of our ancestors as a follower of the Way [Christianity], which they call a sect. I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets, 15 and I have the same hope in God as these men themselves have, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. 16 So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man. 17 “After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings. 18 I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance. 19 But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me. 20 Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin— 21 unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence: ‘It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’”</p>

    <h4>Acts 26, 27, 28</h4>
    <p>Our testimony as Christians should be a statement of faith in Jesus Christ detailing the changes He has made within us as a result of our faith. It is meant to show an unbelieving world that there has been some measurable change within us that could not have been possible without the Spirit of God being present in our life. We become kinder, gentler people, more humble and less selfish and more empathetic to the needs of the suffering around us.</p>
    <p>Paul, having grown up as a devout Jew living in strict obedience to their ways, had a vision from God on his way to Damascus, while he was enroute to persecute Christians for their "blaspheme" against the God. He was a fierce opponent of Christianity until he encountered the Lord.</p>
    <p>Here is Paul's testimony in his own words, given to King Agrippa while on trial for his faith near Jerusalem (found in Acts 26):</p>
    <p>9 “I too was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth. 10 And that is just what I did in Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests I put many of the Lord’s people in prison, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them. 11 Many a time I went from one synagogue to another to have them punished, and I tried to force them to blaspheme. I was so obsessed with persecuting them that I even hunted them down in foreign cities.</p>
    <p>12 “On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests. 13 About noon, King Agrippa, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, blazing around me and my companions. 14 We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’</p>
    <p>15 “Then I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’</p>
    <p>“ ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,’ the Lord replied. 16 ‘Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen and will see of me. 17 I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them 18 to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’</p>
    <p>19 “So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven. 20 First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and then to the Gentiles, I preached that they should repent and turn to God and demonstrate their repentance by their deeds. 21 That is why some Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me. 22 But God has helped me to this very day; so I stand here and testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen— 23 that the Messiah would suffer and, as the first to rise from the dead, would bring the message of light to his own people and to the Gentiles.”</p>

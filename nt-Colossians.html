    <h2>The Letter to the Colossians</h2>
    
    <h4>Colossians 1, 2</h4>
    <p>In Colossians, Paul writes to refute false teaching and heresy that had popped up in the church at Colosse.  The city of Colosse was a smaller market-town located on the Lycus River and on the great east-west trading route from Ephesus, on the Aegean Sea to the Euphrates River in the middle east.  The young church in Colosse had become the target of heretical attack and Paul wrote the letter to steer the theology of the early believers back on track.</p>

    <p>The Zondervan Introduction to the letter in the NIV tells us that Paul never explicitly references the false teaching he opposes here, but some suggestions are put forth as to which particular heresy he is refuting, by inferences in the letter itself:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ceremonialism: “It held to strict rules about the kinds of permissible food and drink, religious festivals (2:16-17) and circumcision (2:11; 3:11).”</li>
        <li>Asceticism: “Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch! (2:21; cf. 2:23)”</li>
        <li>Angel worship: “See 2:18.”</li>
        <li>Depreciation of Christ: “This is implied in Paul’s emphasis on the supremacy of Christ (1:15-20; 2:2-3, 9).”</li>
        <li>Secret Knowledge: “The Gnostics boasted of this (see 2:18 and Paul’s emphasis in 2:2-3 on Christ, “in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom”).”</li>
        <li>Reliance on human wisdom and tradition. “See 2:4, 8.”</li>
    </ol>

    <p>These false teachings seem to fall into two main categories – Jewish and Gnostic – and it is likely the Colossian heresy was a mixture of extreme Judaism and an early stage of Gnosticism.</p>

    <h4>Colossians 3, 4</h4>
    
    <p>In Colossians Chapter 3, Paul again hammers down on the point of living practically for the Christian.  He does this by first stating what behaviors are indicative of a life being lived “outside” of Christ:</p>

    <p>“5 Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. 6 Because of these, the wrath of God is coming. 7 You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived. 8 But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. 9 Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices 10 and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.”</p>

    <p>Paul then follows this up with stating what a life lived “in” Christ should look like:</p>

    <p>“12 Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. 13 Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. 14 And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. 15 Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. 16 Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. 17 And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.”</p>

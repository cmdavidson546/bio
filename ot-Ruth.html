    <h1>The Book of Ruth</h1>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    
    <p>Ruth is the story of a woman with amazing faith.  Her faith is so well known today (by Christians and Jews) that she is only 1 of 2 woman who have entire books of the Bible dedicated to her (the other is Esther).  Ruth was the daughter in law of a Jewish woman, but she herself was not Jewish.  Ruth's faith in God and her compassion for other people was so great that God ultimately blesses her and makes her a great-grandmother of the Lord Jesus himself.  This is her story...</p>

<h4>Chapter 1</h4>

<p>To begin the story, there is a great famine in the land of Israel.  The story takes place around 1300 B.C.  Ruth is married and her and her husband and his family (who are Israeli) move to another place (Moab) in order to look for food.  However, Ruth's husband dies.  Then, her husband's brother and father die and Ruth is left with her Mother in law and her sister in law, together.</p>

<h4>Chapter 2</h4>

<p>A couple of things that are important here.  1.  Boaz is a relative of Naomi (which becomes important later because Boaz is called a "Kinsman redeemer"); 2.  The Law of Moses required all large farm owners to allow the poor to pick up the leftover harvest of the fields...this shows you that God's heart is always for the poor and even if a person is rich they are expected by the Lord to take care of the poor people; 3.  Boaz grants Ruth the ability to stay on his land and pick what she needs because he heard about how Ruth stayed with her mother-in-law and is caring for her...something that was not common in those days; 4.  God rewards Ruth for her faithfulness in this life (as well as the next) where he leads her into a protection of one of his own people (Boaz).  5.  Boaz is a true man of God (greeting people with a blessing, allowing Ruth and all poor people to harvest his land for free, etc.).</p>

<p>The second part of Chapter 2.  I think the biggest part to notice in this section is how DIFFERENT Boaz is from among the rest of his kind.  He is a true man of God who takes compassion on the poor and allows them to take food from his farm without anything in return.  This is not common in this time period where people were much more brutal and viscous than even today... and even Noami says as much in verse 22 where she says, "It will be good for you ... because in someone else's field you might be harmed."</p>

<p>Also important to note is the turning point in the story where Noami (who was so filled with hopelessness in the chapters prior (i.e., she complains she is old, poor, and there is not hope for her) and now she finds out about her "Kinsman redeemer" (see verse 20) who is now taking care of Ruth and Noami.  A kinsman-redeemer in ancient days was a close relative of someone who had the responsibility to protect the interests of poor and needy members of his own family.  Not everyone did this act in those days, even though God commands it (see Deuteronomy 25:5-10; Leviticus 25:25-28; and 47-49; and Numbers 35:19-21, where a family member would be responsible for "avenging" the killing of a relative.  Boaz is a special character in the Bible and represents the character of Jesus Christ and his mercy on the poor and needy of all humanity.  Boaz is considered to be an Old Testament depiction of the care and compassion that Jesus would bring to the world over a 1000 years later (dated from this story).</p>

<h4>Chapter 3</h4>

<p>So.  This is the first part to chapter 3 and it is an important part of this story.  By going to lie at a master's feet, Naomi was instructing Ruth to ask Boaz to marry her.  This is one way it was done in those ancient days.  It appears that it was common in "Kinsman-redeemer" situations.</p>

<p>Remember that a Kinsman-Redeemer is a close relative of a poor/destitute/widowed family member that has an obligation to "redeem" or "rescue" that poor family member from a variety of different situations.  One of which is to marry the wife of a family member who died.  Here, Boaz is a family member of Naomi.  Ruth's husband, Naomi's son, died.  So Boaz is being asked to "redeem" Ruth here as Naomi's son's family member.  That is why she goes to lay at his feet.</p>

<p>Notice in verse 12 that Boaz says to Ruth that "there is a kinsman-redeemer nearer than I."  which means that there was someone else in the family of Naomi that was obligated to accept/deny help to Naomi and Ruth before Boaz can step in to save them.</p>

<p>Also, notice how, like I said before, Boaz represents the Lord Jesus in this story.  Ruth represents anyone who wants to be "redeemed" by Jesus.  Notice that Ruth has to follow certain obligations and guidelines (i.e., lay at the feet of the redeemer, ask for covering) and Boaz is obligated to help but must follow the Law (i.e., remove any obstacles to redeeming Ruth by first addressing the "other" kinsman that is "nearer" to her in this life).  For now, just note these parallels between Boaz and Jesus, then between Ruth as a picture of all humanity seeking to be saved.</p>

<p>So in the second part of Chapter 3 we see a "switch" occur in the story.  Boaz becomes Ruth's "Redeemer".  From this point on in the remaining passages, it is important for you to imagine Boaz as a picture of Jesus Christ, and Ruth, as a picture of all humanity.  These passages are instructive as to how we, as humanity, (Ruth) are to act as we approach and seek out the Lord Jesus (Boaz) in our own lives.</p>

<p>Notice how these last verses of Chapter 3 show us (humanity, Ruth) are to act with Jesus (Boaz).  We have to follow certain procedures (lying at his feet, waiting for him to act before we act, etc.).  Then we are to wait on the Lord for blessing and direction.  In these verses of Chapter 3 you'll read how the Lord (Boaz) blesses Ruth (humanity) so abundantly it is beyond her expectations.  He does not send Ruth away empty handed because she has approached him in a way that was holy and pure and with an honest heart.  Instead, unexpectedly, Boaz pours a very large abundant amount of barley into her shawl/pack, because (a) he knew she needed it and (b) he knew it would remove any worry in the future about starving for her and Noami.  Boaz does what Jesus does for his people every day, even today.</p>

<h4>Chapter 4</h4>

<p>Chapter 4 in the book of Ruth is the final chapter whereby Boaz (the kinsman "redeemer") actually has to settle all claims to the land that Naomi owned.  In those days, if a man died with a wife, a nearby relative of the man who died was obligated to buy his land and take his wife as his own, in order to preserve the family line and keep all property and inheritance within the family.  It seems ridiculous today, but it was very important in those ancient days (1300 BC) to keep land in the family.  In this case, there apparently was someone other than Boaz that was "first in line" by law that could have taken the land of Naomi and also Ruth as a wife of his dead kinsmen (relative).</p>

<p>Interestingly, we read that the guy who was first-in-line to buy the land, at first says, "Yeah, I'll take it."  But, then once Boaz tells him he will also be responsible for taking care of Ruth as his wife, the man backs out and tells Boaz to "redeem" the land in his place.  This shows us again how kind and generous Boaz was...because no one else wanted to do what he did...to redeem the family land of Naomi or take on another mouth to feed in a new wife (Ruth).</p>

<p>So that is what is going on in these first few chapters.  I am always on the lookout for "LAW" stuff in the Bible.  And here, we have a very ancient text, that actually shows us "CONTRACT LAW" in 1300 BC and how business was conducted in a legal framework.  Notice how the contract between the two men is conducted.  First, verses 1-2, tell us that all major contracts and business were conducted at the "town gate" or at the entrance to the city.  This is consistent with all the other ancient texts of Mesopotamia and Egypt at this time on how important matters were conducted.  Next, Boaz needed to gather a group of "elders" who would be witnesses to the contract negotiations.  Then, in verses 7-8, after discussing the terms, and Boaz winning the contract, they actually had to take off their shoes and give those shoes to one another in order to finalize the contract.  Finally, in verse 9, Boaz makes the announcement of the deal to the elders and calls them as witnesses to the deal (in case one of the parties tried to back out later).</p>

<p>The final piece to the story of Ruth and Boaz is that God rewards them mightily for their faithfulness to doing the right thing by each other.  Ruth, who was not a Jew, left her homeland (Moab) and the gods of her people (pagan worship in Moab), to care for an old widow (Naomi) who had little to no hope of a good life after her husband and sons died.  Boaz, a family member of Naomi, did not have to "redeem" the land of Naomi's husband or marry Ruth, which is shown by the guy who actually did pass up the opportunity before Boaz in the story...but yet Boaz shows his kindness to the poor (letting them take food from his land) and to widows (Naomi and Ruth) and ultimately provides them with a good life in a world that was a tough world to live in for a widow.</p>

<p>So the final part of Chapter 4 tells us that Boaz and Ruth actually have a son named Obed.  Obed was the father of Jesse (Isai) and Jesse was the father of King David.  David is a great-great-ect grandfather of Jesus Christ himself.  And so, Ruth and Boaz are ancestors of the Messiah Jesus, which is no small matter.</p>

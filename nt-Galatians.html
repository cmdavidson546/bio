    <h2>The Letter to the Galatians</h2>
    
    <h4>Galatians 1, 2, 3</h4>
    <p>The letter to the Galatians is called the “Magna Carta of Christian Liberty.” Galatians stands as an eloquent and vigorous proof for the essential New Testament truth that people are justified by faith in Jesus Christ – by nothing less and nothing more – and that they are sanctified not by legalistic works but by the obedience that comes from faith in God’s work for them, in them and through them by the grace and power of Christ and the Holy Spirit.  It was the rediscovery of the basic message of Galatians (and Romans) that brought about the Protestant Reformation.  Galatians is also referred to as “Luther’s Book” because Martin Luther relied so strongly on this letter in all his preaching, teaching and writing.  </p>

    <p>The background to the letter is that Judaizers (Jewish Christians who believed, among other things, that a number of the ceremonial practices of the Old Testament were still binding on the New Testament church), were insisting that Galatian (Greek) converts to Christianity abide by certain Old Testament rites, especially circumcision.  They may have been motivated by a desire to avoid the persecution of outside zealot Jews who objected to any fraternizing with Gentiles (Old Testament Law forbid Jewish people from, in many ways, associating with non-Jews because they were considered “unclean”).  These Judaizers argued that Paul was not an authentic apostle and that, out of a desire to make the message more appealing to Gentiles, Paul removed certain legal requirements of the faith from his gospel.</p>

    <p>Paul responds to them by writing this letter to the Galatians.  He establishes his apostolic authority directly from his encounter with Jesus Christ on the road to Damascus and thereby substantiates the gospel he has been preaching to the church in Galatia.  By introducing additional requirements for justification (e.g., works of the law) his adversaries were perverting the gospel of grace and, unless prevented, would bring these new converts of Christianity into the bondage of legalism.  It is by grace through faith alone that people are justified, and it is by faith alone that they are to live out their new life in the freedom of the Spirit.</p>
    <p>All of the above is taken from and adapted from Zondervan NIV Introduction to the Book of Galatians.</p>

    <h4>Galatians 4, 5, 6</h4>
    
    <p>“The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.” [Gal 5:6].</p>

    <p>CHARGE: “The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies and the like.” [5:19-21a]</p>

    <p>INDICTMENT: “I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.” [5:21b]</p>

    <p>PLEA: “So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature.  For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature.  They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want.  But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law.” [5:16-18]</p>

    <p>The idea behind the principle of Christian freedom is such that the indictment that Paul gives above is for those who live under the legalism of a worldly spirit.  But, it can be thrown out of God’s Holy Court for anyone who lives according to the Spirit of Jesus Christ.  For as Paul tells us, “Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires.  Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.  Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.” [5:24].  “...the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.  Against such things there is no law.” [5:22-23].</p>

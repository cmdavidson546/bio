    <h1>Toward an Abortion Law</h1>
    <h4>Chapter 1</h4>
    <p>First, I propose the following Constitutional Amendment, not on religious grounds, but on a moral ground that ensures all future generations of this country that our laws will protect life, in all of its stages of development.</p>
    <p>28th Amendment of the United States Constitution</p>
    <ol>
        <li>All life has value and to that end, no person shall be authorized to perform an abortive procedure of a human fetus, unless:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>The fetus is less than three months of development and certified by a medical doctor; and</li>
            <li>A certificate of abortion has been issued by a neutral and detached magistrate, upon a private hearing between (a) the petitioner for abortion, (b) the biological male donor who was involved in the creation of the fetus, but only upon notice, and only if against the abortive procedure, and (c) a gaurdian ad litem representing the interests of the unborn child on behalf of the State, and upon expert medical evidence by a neutral and detached medical doctor, whether by written or oral argument, is convinced by a preponderance of evidence, that the full term birth of the child represents a danger to the health, welfare or safety of the petitioner; or</li>   
            <li>A certificate of any court of jurisdiction showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the fetus was created as the product of the crime of rape, as defined by the criminal statute of the state of residency of the petitioner, and shown by a criminal conviction; or</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Notwithstanding any of the above requirements, an abortion may be performed by a medical doctor, proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the abortive procedure was necessary and immediate in order to preserve the health, welfare or safety of the petitioner.</li>
    </ol>

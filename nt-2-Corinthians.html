    <h2>The Book of 2 Corinthians</h2>
    
    <h4>2 Corinthians 1</h4>
    <p>So, why did Paul need to write a second letter to the Corinthians?  Here is a little historical background taken directly out of the "Introduction" section of my NIV Zondervan Study Bible:</p>

    <p>"It seems that Paul wrote as many as four letters to the church at Corinth: (1) an [unknown to the modern reader] letter referred to in 1 Cor 5:9; (2) 1 Corinthians; (3) a "severe" letter (mentioned in 2 Cor 2:3-4) [also unknown to the modern reader]; and (4) 2 Corinthians."  After writing 1 Corinthians Paul continued his ministry at Ephesus until he heard that his first letter had not completely accomplished its purpose with the Corinthian believers.  "A group of men had come to Corinth who presented themselves as apostles.  They were false teachers who were challenging, among other things, paul's personal integreity and his authority as an apostle (see, 2 Cor 11:4; 12:11)."</p>

    <p>"In the face of this serious situation Paul decided to make a quick trip to Corinth (see, 2 Cor 12:4; 13:1-2) to see whether he could remedy the situation.  The vist turned out to be painful and it also did not accomplish its purpose.  So when Paul returned to Ephesus, he wrote the Corinthians a sever letter "out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears" (see 2 Cor 2:4)."</p>

    <p>"After writing the severe letter, Paul had second thoughts.  He was deeply concerned about how the Corinthians might react to it" [think about how many emails or texts you've sent out and wanted to recall them!].  So...he left Ephesus and set out for Macedonia expecting to meet Titus to get news of the effect of his severe letter, but Titus was not there (see 2 Cor 2:12-13).  Eventually, Paul met up with TItus in Macedonia.  "To his relief, the news from the Corinthian Church was basically good.  The severe letter had brought its intended results (see 2 Cor 7:5-16).  The encouraging report of Titus of the improved situation at Corinth is the immediate occasion of the writing of 2 Corinthians."</p>

    <p>You will find that Chapters 10 - 13 of 2 Corinthians have a much harsher tone than do the first 9 Chapters.  Several explanations for this exist:  (1) it was in fact the "severe" letter mentioned above; (2) in the middle of writing this second letter, Paul got a report of some bad behaviors and wanted to address them; (3) these chapters represent a fifth letter and constitute a completely separate letter that was merged over time.  There is no evidence to support any of these and we should just take the letter as-is as one single letter, whatever the reason.</p>

    <h4>2 Corinthians 2, 3, 4</h4>
    <p>In these passages Paul makes a point to bring the focus of his readers toward God to whom he gives all the glory for everything about his life and his own work as a minister and deliverer of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  In my own life, I used to take such pride in the idea that I was a "self-made" man...that I went out on my own and did some cool things with my life...and I thought I had done all of it in a vacuum on my own.  But, then one day I realized how much support I have received from God, my parents, my family and my friends such that it would have been impossible for me to have gotten to the place I am now without a lifteim of support.  I would never have made it even halfway up the hill that I've climbed without the love and support of so many people in my life on a regular and consistent basis.  I therefore had to change my thinking on this core belief I had about myself and introspectively face the reality that I am not a "self made" man, but rather, I am made chiefly from God, but also very much from the people who raised me, supported me, encouraged me and continue to do so, even to this very day.  It's not an easy thing to do though...to admit that you are an idiot...and face the truth of a lie you have been living...but nonetheless it brings growth and transformation.  As Jesus tells us, the "Truth shall set you free" (John 8:31-32).</p>
    
    <p>In the same light, I can take absolutely no pride or credit for the gift of faith that I have been given spirtually in my life.  It is purely by the Grace of God that my faith in Jesus is steadfast within this modern age.  To quote the late great Billy Graham - "All that I have been able to do, I owe to Jesus Christ".  I believe that this is what Paul is getting at over and over in these passages from 2 Corinthians when he speaks of (1:3-4) "the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God," (1:9-10) "But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God...On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us," (1:12) "We have done so not according to worldly wisdom but according to God's grace," (1:21-22) "Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us, set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come," (3:4-6) "Such confidence we have through Christ before God. Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God. He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant," (3:18) "And we all, who with unveiled faces reflect the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord," (4:7) "But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us ," and (4:15) "All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God."</p>
    
    <p>Do you have the ability to look inward and see all that God has done for you in your life.  More importantly, if you can see it, are you willing to confess your sins to an unseen Lord and give your Glory to God?  The reason we need to set our own pride and boasting aside for the sake of giving Glory to God is made plain in Paul's statement in 4:2-6: "2 Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience in the sight of God. 3 And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. 4 The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. 5 For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake. 6 For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God’s glory displayed in the face of Christ."</p>

    <h4>2 Corinthians 5, 6, 7</h4>
    <p>Chapter 5 is a little dense.  Paul talks about the ministry of reconciliation.  Reconciliation to God became necessary once Adam and Eve introduced original Sin into the world thereby causing a separation between God and mankind.  A 100% Holy and Righteous God simply cannot be in union with something less than 100% holy and righteous... its just mathematics... and if God, in His perfection, were in union with man, who is less than perfect, then God would be something less than 100% Holy and Righteous, right?  For as Paul says in 2 Co 6:14, "For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?"  But, by the Grace of God, and in the natural course of time, God sent His only begotten Son to reconcile us to Him so that through Christ all of our unrighteousness could be covered by God's Grace and not by our own actions.  Such reconciliation is not and could not spring forth from our own doing because we are less than perfect.  Therefore, it must come from God.  But, why do we need such reconciliation?  Because, as Paul tells us in 2 Cor 5:10, "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad."  Or, do you believe that people like Hitler and Stalin and others just die and have no eternal consequence to their wicked ways?</p>
    
    <p>I know this does not sit well with the unbeliever who says, 'why should I be judged by anyone!'  Or, another argument I have heard is, 'I am a good person and if there is a God, surely he would not penalize me!' or, 'I have never killed anyone so what I have done to deserve eternal punishment!'.  In our pride, we think we are good people.  And most people are pretty decent...but aren't we complicit in the evils of this world somehow and on some level, each and every one of us?  For  people who are here in America, do we not consume material goods at an excessive rate - clothing made from sweat factories and the labor of children, electronics made from mining operations that work people to death overseas, or machines that use oil that is destroying our environment.  Don't we advocate and vote for politicians with speeches that promote the killing of unborn babies for the sake of freedom of 'choice', or they villainize people on the basis of race and country of origin, or they lack compassion for the homeless, the sick and the poor of their own nation?  We are all complicit on some level of the crimes against humanity that plague our existence.  Sure, you may never have killed anyone... but what about the people that died to bring you the diamond rings you wear on your body or the rare minerals you hold in your hand through your iPhone?  What about the son you bore that holds his knee on the neck of the oppressed in the name of the law?  We are all complicit even though we do not realize it.</p>
    
    <p>And, so God sent His Son for all who believe in Him to take up their cross to help carry the weight of our sins by sharing with others what God has accomplished through His Son.  Simply believing in Jesus Christ as the only path to God leads to repentance and a true remorse for the ways of this world against our fellow man.  As Paul says in 2 Cor 7:10, "Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death."  Therefore, transform yourselves through the reconciliation that God provides, as Paul says in 2 Cor 5:17, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!  All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men's sins against them."</p>

    <h4>2 Corinthians 8, 9, 10</h4>
    <p>In Chapters 8 and 9, Paul is essentially introducing the doctrine of tithing (e.g., “giving”) to the believers (church members) of the Corinthian Church.  It is a doctrine for the members of the church and not meant for unbelievers outside the church.  Paul is calling on the new Christian believers to give out of their abundance of wealth in Greece so he can carry it to other churches in the world who had very little in terms of basic necessities.  As Paul says in 8:13, “Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality.”  The New Testament believer is not under any compulsion to give, as was the case in the Old Testament law of “tithing,” but he gives out of the abundance of love and compassion in his heart because Jesus’ ministry was centered around helping the poor and oppressed of His day.  The Christian truly understands “the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,” which Paul says in 8:9, “that though he [Jesus] was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that you, through his poverty, might become rich.”  That is the principle behind Christian giving.</p>
    
    <p>But, is this proof that a Christian must (or should) be a Socialist minded citizen today!?  Absolutely not!  Under socialism (or communism), the citizen is forced to give a set percentage of their income (60% or higher in today’s going socialist rate) to the government and then a redistribution of wealth occurs according to political need and design, rather than an actual need and compassion (see, Russia, China and Cuba, for example).  Under a New Testament system of Christian giving, it seems to me, it would work best under free-market capitalism because the giving is not done under compulsion, but rather under the free-will to give whatever one has, according to their own heart’s desire as to who needs their gift.  Paul states this plainly, in 8:12, “For if the willingness is there the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what he does not have.”</p>
    
    <p>But, those living for Christ today, who are bearing the fruit of His Tree of Life, will give abundantly and generously always.  Any Christian who tithes regularly knows the truth that God blesses those who bless others.  I can certainly testify to the fact that once I began formally “tithing,” I have never worried about money.  In some cases, when I needed money the most, it was pretty miraculous how I made it through… but you would have to just trust in God on your own and start doing it to truly understand what the Christian believer already knows about this truth.  This is what Paul announces in 9:6-11, “Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.  Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work. As it is written: ‘They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor; their righteousness endures forever.’  Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness. You will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.”</p>

    <h4>2 Corinthians 11, 12, 13</h4>
    <p>Paul is urging the Church in Corinth to stay the course in their faith.  At that time, there were many people who saw the power of the Apostles – “signs, wonders and miracles” [12:12] – and they attempted to replicate such powers without adhering to the Truth that Christ taught.  They would go around perverting the Gospel in one way or another and, in gaining a following through their lies, they were stealing people away from the Truth that is in Christ Jesus.  As Paul tells us in 11:13-15, “For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ.  And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.  It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness.  Their end will be what their actions deserve.”</p>
    
    <p>In the modern context, think about some of the preachers you may have seen on TV or churches you may have visited in your lifetime.  Think about the priests of the Catholic Church, masquerading as “servants of righteousness,” all the while molesting children and hiding their deeds from the world in darkness.  Even to a lesser extent, there are false churches who are calling out loud in their worship services, talking in complete gibberish and calling it “speaking in tongues”?  Or, there are some churches telling people that “handling poisonous snakes” is the mark of a true believer?  There are so many agents of Satan leading people astray in this world!  But you can always tell whether something is “of God” or “not of God” by having the knowledge of the Gospel in your heart and comparing such actions and teachings against the Scriptures in order to ascertain the truth of the matter on your own.  You will be able to tell whether a church is working for or against the Kingdom of God by the manifestation of God’s work in the lives of its members – as Paul says in 12:20, where there is “quarreling, jealousy, outburst of anger, factions, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder” then God is not present in that particular Church.  Flee from it quickly and go find a church that only teaches one Gospel – the Gospel of Jesus Christ!  This is what the Biblical principle of “spiritual discernment” means and it must be cultivated by reading the Bible on a consistent basis.</p>
    
    <p>Therefore, be aware of false teachers of God!  This is as true today as it was in Paul’s time.  There is one Gospel and it has not changed for over 2000 years.  The only way to tell if a teacher is a false teacher of the Gospel is to know the Gospel for yourself.  That is why I am urging you to read the New Testament for yourself so that you can have the knowledge of truth in order to be able to examine what false teachers say about God and compare what they say with what the Bible says about living a Godly lifestyle.  If anyone preaches a Gospel other than the one in the New Testament, they are false teachers and should be avoided at all costs.</p>

  <h1>New Testament Commentary</h1>

    <h2>Book 2 Thessalonians</h2>

    <h4>2 Thessalonians 1, 2, 3</h4>
    <p>In 2 Thessalonians 1, Paul continues the theme of "end times" theology:  <em>“This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels. 8 He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. 9 They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might 10 on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at among all those who have believed.”</em></p>

    <p>The chaos, unrest and injustice of the last days are setting up the human need for a leader to swoop in and lie about bringing peace and prosperity to the earth through human reason.  Paul tells us about this person in 2 Thessalonians, Chapter 2:</p>

    <p><em>“3 Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. 4 He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple, proclaiming himself to be God.”</em></p>

    <p><em>“6 And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time. 7 For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way. 8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming. 9 The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie, 10 and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. 11 For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie 12 and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.”</em></p>

    <p>In the last chapter of the second letter to the Thessalonians, it is Paul’s last evangelical letter to the churches in the New Testament (cf. the Pastoral Letters and Philemon).</p>

    <p>Paul’s hardships, struggles and thoughts are written out explicitly in the New Testament from Acts Chapter 9 to the Letter to Philemon.  Paul is a fascinating character from the ancient world and has had a huge impact on the trajectory of Western Civilization and human thought in general.  His message was of the love of God and the salvation that comes through a knowledge based on faith in Jesus Christ.  The remaining letters in the New Testament are the “Pastoral Letters”, “Letter to the Hebrews”, “General Letters”, and “The Book of Revelation” which are all instructive in their own way and worthy of the canonical status given to them.</p>

    <p>I would urge everyone to take 90 days and about 10 minutes a day out of their super busy lives to read the New Testament and ask God to come into your life to work through any doubts or unbelief you might have in His Son Jesus Christ.  I can promise you that it will change your life for the better.  I’ll end with some of Paul’s final words in the New Testament, found in 2 Thessalonians 3:</p>

    <p><em>“Finally, brothers, pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you. And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men, for not everyone has faith.  But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen and protect you from the evil one. We have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do the things we command.  May the Lord direct your hearts into God’s love and Christ’s perseverance.”</em></p>

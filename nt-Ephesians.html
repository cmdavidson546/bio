    <h2>The Letter to the Ephesians</h2>

    <h4>Ephesians 1, 2, 3</h4>
    <p>The city of Ephesus was the most important city in Asia Minor (now Turkey) during the days of the Roman Empire.  It was located on the most direct sea and land route of the eastern provinces of the empire and no city in Asia was more famous or more populated.  It ranked with Rome, Corinth, Antioch and Alexandria as the foremost urban centers of the empire.  Ephesus boasted about their temple of Artemis (Diana), which is one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.  In Ephesus, Paul preached to large crowds of people, and probably spent about 3 years there teaching and preaching.  Recall from The Book of Acts, Chapter 19, that the silversmiths in Ephesus complained that Paul had influenced so many people there, to believe in Jesus Christ, that they were no longer buying idols to worship the false pagan gods.</p>

    <p>In this letter, “Paul seeks to explain God’s wisdom, forethought and purpose in salvation through Jesus Christ and His Church.  Paul emphasizes that we have been saved, not only for our own personal benefit, but also to bring praise and glory to God.”  God’s plan for salvation is as follows: (1) reconcile individuals to Himself, as an act of His grace (see, 2:1-10); (2) reconcile these saved individuals to each other, through Christ (see, 2:11-22); (3) unite these reconciled individuals in one body, the church, which has been revealed to Paul by the Holy Spirit (see, 3:1-6).  It is important to note that the idea here of the “Church” has nothing to do with the modern definition of the word “church”.  Paul is talking about a “body of believers” scattered across the world, where individuals are as “members of one body, in Christ,” who worship the Lord in Spirit.  It is not a physical building where some believers and some non-believers gather together every Sunday to celebrate some kind of “mass” or hear a sermon.</p>

    <p>Even though the letter contains a repetition of the phrase “heavenly realms,” our lives as believers are to be clearly lived out on earth daily.  But, practical daily life continues to work out the great mystery and purposes of God, where the unity of the church, under the headship of Christ, foreshadows the uniting of all things in heaven and on earth under Christ.  The old way of living stands in stark contrast to the new life of purity in Christ (see, 4:17 – 6:9).  Those who are strong in the Lord will have victory over evil in the daily spiritual conflict, which comes especially to the believers who exercise the power of prayer in their lives (see, 6:10-20).</p>
    <p>All of the above is taken from and adapted from Zondervan NIV Introduction to the Book of Ephesians.</p>

    <h4>Ephesians 4, 5, 6</h4>

    <p>In conjunction with the Gospel of Matthew, chapters 5, 6 and 7, these three chapters in Ephesians are my favorite verses in the entire Bible.  I am a practical Christian and have a strong desire to know “the rules” of the game, so that I can play the game to win.  I think, when read together, Matthew 5, 6 and 7 and Ephesians 4, 5 and 6, give a completely clear picture of what God expects of the Christian believer in this life.  Sure, you need other (different) verses to get you to cross the divide, from unbelief to belief, but once you are standing on the other side of the gulf, at the start line, I truly believe you can run a really good race with just these six chapters alone.</p>

    <p>For hundreds of years, our society has taken in these truths and evolved with them in mind, so that our children, for generations, were brought up understanding what God expects of us.  Our human weakness required the process to be slow and painful throughout our history, but, we stand now on the shoulders of the giants of faith that came before us – Jonathan Edwards (leader of the First Great Awakening), John Harvard (of whom Harvard University is named after), William Wilberforce (world advocate of the abolition of slavery), Martin Luther King, Jr. (leader of the Civil Rights Movement), Billy Graham (American revivalist Preacher).  These men had a vision of a better society, formed not from the minds of men, but out of an obedience to God and His Will.</p>

    <p>Ephesians focuses on what our ethical considerations should be in daily life: “Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace” (Eph 4:2-3); “put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor” (4:25); “ ’In your anger do not sin’: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold” (4:26-27); “Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with their own hands, that they may have something to share with those in need” (4:28); “Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen” (4:29); “Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice” (4:30); “Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you” (4:31); “Follow God’s example, therefore, as dearly loved children and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us” (5:1-2); “Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ” (5:19-20).</p>

    <p>Then, we also learn what we should not be doing and Paul offers some suggestions on how to counteract bad behavior: “[T]here must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God’s holy people” (5:3); “Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving” (5:4); “For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person—such a person is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God” (5:5); “Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God’s wrath comes on those who are disobedient. Therefore do not be partners with them” (5:6-7); “Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil” (5:15-16); “Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is” (5:17); “Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit” (5:18).</p>

    <p>It seems today, with our society moving away from acknowledging the providence of God, that we have lost our way.  Just look at all the chaos that has caused.</p>

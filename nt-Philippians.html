  <h1>New Testament Commentary</h1>

    <h2>The Letter to the Philippians</h2>

    <h4>Philippians 1, 2, 3</h4>
    <p>“And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ—to the glory and praise of God.” Phil 1:9-10.</p>

    <p>Paul is writing to the church in Philippi from prison to say thank you for all the help they have provided him.  It is a missionary “thank you” letter to the church for their support of his mission of preaching the Gospel in foreign lands.  In this letter, the introduction from the Zondervan NIV tells us, Paul uses the letter to (1) report of his own circumstances, (2) to encourage the Philippians to stand firm in their faith in the face of persecution, (3) rejoice regardless of circumstances, (4) to walk in humility and unity in the individual believer and the church, and (5) to warn them against the false teachings of the legalists (Judaizers) and antinomians (Libertines) among them.</p>

    <h4>Philippians 4</h4>

    <p>In Philippians 4, Paul closes the letter with some great encouragements –

    <p>“4 Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! 5 Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. 6 Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. 7 And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”</p>

    <p>“8 Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. 9 Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.”</p>

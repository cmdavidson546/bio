  <h1>New Testament Commentary</h1>
    
    <h2>1st Letter of Peter (1 Peter) </h2>
    
    <h4>1 Peter Introduction, 1</h4>

<p>It was/is widely accepted that 1 Peter was (a) written by the Apostle Peter and (b) written about 60 AD.  The letter has uncharacteristic marks of being written by a scribe rather than by Peter’s own hand.  Given that we know Peter was an untrained fisherman from Galilee, the letter is written is excellent Greek style whereas 2 Peter is written in crude style.  It is thought Silas was the writer who helped Peter format the letter into high Greek.</p>

<p>Chapter 1 begins with a story of hope.  Peter clings to the hope that was taught to him, by letting believers know that the Lord has prepared their salvation, by His Mercy and through His Son, Jesus, and they should rejoice in this fact alone.  However, they may face trials before the day of salvation...and he answers why this occurs: “These have come so that your faith...may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.” (1:7).</p>

<p>Peter tells us that all the OT prophets predicted this time would come and predicted the Glory of God would follow the sufferings of His Christ.  “Therefore, prepare your minds for action:  be self-controlled, set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed.  As obedient children do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance.  But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do;” (1:13-15).  We are to live as “strangers” here in this world (1:17), since our lives are redeemed by a currency not valued in this place (the blood of Christ, 1:19), where the only thing valued here will perish (silver and gold, 1:18).</p>

<p>So, Peter re-sends the message of the believer: “He [Jesus] was chosen before the creation of the world but was revealed in these last times for your sake.  Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, and so your faith and hope are in God.” (1:20-21).  Once we believe that in our hearts, we are “purified by obeying the truth” (1:22a) and this produces a “sincere love for your brothers” and a desire to “love one another deeply, from the heart.” (1:22b).  Here is the hallmark of the Christian believer.</p>

<h4>1 Peter 2, 3</h4>

<p>Peter begins chapter 2 by telling believers to wake up!  and to “rid yourselves of”:</p>
<ol>
<li>all malice;</li>
<li>all deceit;</li>
<li>hypocrisy;</li>
<li>envy;</li>
<li>slander of every kind.</li>
</ol>
    
<p>“so that by it you may grow up in your salvation, now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.”  For the believer, Jesus is the “living Stone” (2:4), the “cornerstone of Zion” (2:6; cf. Isa 28:16, “and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.”) and is “precious” to those who believe in Him. (2:7)  But, Peter urges the believers, </p>
<ol>
<li>“as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from sinful desires, which war against your soul.” (2:11).</li>
<li>We are called to live good lives “among the pagans” that should demonstrate to them the nature of God’s will and so make them have no choice but “glorify God on the day he visits us.” (2:12).</li>
<li>“Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every authority instituted among men” (2:13)</li>
<li>“For it is God’s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men.” (2:15)</li>
<li>“Live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God.” (2:16)</li>
<li>“Show proper respect to everyone:</li>
<li>Love the brotherhood of believers.</li>
<li>fear God.</li>
<li>honor the king.” (2:17)</li>
</ol>
<p>However, Jesus actually becomes a stumbling block for those who do not believe.  Peter says, “They stumble because they [unbelievers] disobey the message” (2:8b).  The message is that Jesus, the Son of God, came and preached good news to the poor, but was crucified for our sins (innate and unredeemable through legal sacrifice) and was resurrected after three days in the grave, which allowed Him to take His place at the right hand of God to rule over all Creation for eternity.  Peter says unbelievers disobey the message “which is also what they were destined for.”  Therefore, God, in His foreknowledge of time, always knows who will believe and who will not believe, and yet still lets it all “play out” to accord with the principle of free will for all humankind.</p>

<p>Peter talks about suffering and makes a distinction between suffering for doing the right thing and suffering because you did the wrong thing.  The former is commendable to God, the latter is deserved.  Jesus left us an example of the former – “When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.” (2:23).  The Lord did this so that “we might die to sins and live for righteousness... For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.” (2:24-25).</p>

<p>In chapter 3, Peter gives us some practical advice alongside some great words of faith.  For example,</p>

<p><b>Statements of Practice</b></p>
    <ul>
<li>Wives, your beauty should not be derived from external appearances.  “Instead, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God’s sight.” (3:4)</li>
<li>Husbands, be considerate to your wives and treat them with respect as: (a) the weaker half and (b) co-heir with you of the gracious gift of (eternal) life. (3:7)</li>
    
<li>To all believers: </li>
    <ul>
<li>“live in harmony with one another; </li>
<li>be sympathetic, </li>
<li>love as brothers, </li>
<li>be compassionate and </li>
<li>humble.  (3:8).</li>
<li>Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing...” (3:9).</li>
    </ul>
<li>In Psalm 34:12 – 16 we read,</li>
    <ul>
<li>“keep his tongue from evil</li>
<li>and his lips from deceitful speech.</li>
<li>He must turn from evil and do good;</li>
        <li>he must seek peace and pursue it.” (3:10)</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
    
<p><b>Statements of Faith</b></p>
    <ul>
<li>Wives, be submissive to your husbands in spirit, “like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her master. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear.” (3:6).</li>
<li>Husbands, treat your wives with respect as listed above, “so that nothing will hinder your prayers” to God.  (3:7)</li>
<li>The reasons Peter gives for obeying both his exhortations to “not repay evil with evil” is so that we, as believers, “may inherit a blessing”. (3:9).</li>
<li>What is the blessing that we will inherit?  Peter quotes the Psalmist and tells us “For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer.” (Psalm 34; 1 Peter 3:12).  This is not true for non-believers (who also are living apart from God’s Way), “but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.” (Psalm 34; 1 Peter 3:12).</li>
    </ul>
<p>Peter goes on to tell us that in most cases, nothing bad will happen to you if you are “eager to do good” things for others. (3: 13).  But, even if harm does come upon you, at least let it come upon you while you are doing the right thing, in God’s eyes, rather than while you are doing the wrong thing... because God will know the truth of the matter.. and in this way you will be “blessed” even in your sufferings. (3:14, 17).</p>

<h4>1 Peter 4, 5</h4>

<p>There is a weird parenthetical at the end of chapter 3 (3:19 – 22) that talks about how Christ went and preached to the spirits in prison from the days of Noah.  Then, chapter 4 begins with the word “Therefore” and this seems to indicate that since 3:19-22 is a parenthetical, 4:1 ties directly back to 3:18.</p>

<p>Peter begins chapter 4 with the statement, “...he who has suffered in his body is done with sin.”  This is followed by the statement, “As a result, he does not live the rest of his earthly life for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God.” (4:2).  So, do we look to suffer?  Should our aim as Christians be suffering?  It does not seem to be what Peter is saying here when you look at the Greek.  Peter is not saying to look to suffer or aim to suffer, but rather, as it came upon the Lord, and as it comes upon you as a believer, embrace it because it kills off the sin that lives within us.</p>

<p>The Greek word used for suffering here is (παθὼν) pathōn meaning “having suffered” and from the root word paschó (Strongs 3958).  It is NOT a form of self-indulgent suffering whereby the person deprives himself of worldly need or desire.  According to Strongs Concordance, its usage, as a verb is such that the person is “acted upon in a certain way, either good or bad (experience ill treatment, suffer).”</p>

<p>The example of enduring an external suffering in order to kill the sin that lives in the flesh is given in the passage as, before becoming believers, “you spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do – living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry. They think it strange that you do not plunge with them into the same flood of dissipation, and they heap abuse on you.  But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.” (4:3 – 5). </p>

<p>To ward off such sinful behavior, with or without suffering involved from the external factors of humanity, as believers, Peter tells us that “For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so that they might be judged according to men in regard to the body, but live according to God in regard to the spirit.” (4:6).  </p>

<p>We are told that the ‘end is near’ and to be “clear-minded and self-controlled so that you can pray.” (4:7).  “Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.  Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling. Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God’s grace in its various forms.” (4:8 – 11).  In all things, speaking or serving others, do it unto God, “so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ.” (4:11).  Judgement will BEGIN with the family of God (believers) (4:17). </p>

<p>For elders, be good shepherds of the flock.  The Chief Shepherd will return someday and you want to be found serving well – do it willingly, not greedy for money, eager to serve, not lording it over anyone, but “being examples to the flock.” (5:3).  For young men, be humble, so that God can lift you up in due time. (5:6).  “Be self-controlled and alert.  Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.  Resist him, standing firm in the faith...And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.” (5:8 – 10).</p>

<p>If you suffer, it is according to God’s will on your life, as one who is called, and such suffering will bring you to a deeper knowledge of Him, therefore, you should commit yourself to a faithful Creator in the suffering, rather than suffer for evil; but, you must continue to do the good things God is commanding you to do in this life, whether suffering or not, so that He may be glorified through your actions in all things seen by those who are going to be judged at the end of time. (See 4:19).</p>

<h2>2nd Letter of Peter (2 Peter)</h2>
    
<h4>2 Peter 1, 2, 3</h4>

<p>Some of the greatest practical Christian wisdom in the Bible, in my opinion, comes from from Peter in this book.  There are some discrepancies between the writing style between 1 and 2 Peter and some earlier authentication disagreement (Clement (95AD), Origen (185-253), Eusebius (265-340)).  However, taken at face value, it seems highly probable that Peter wrote this letter, given the language and authority of its message.</p>

<p>The message is to “make your calling and election sure” (1:10).  You see, Christ died for us and in dying has given us everything we need for life and godliness through a knowledge of him, “who called us by his own glory and goodness. (1:3).  Furthermore, God has made some promises attached to that calling, “so that through them [the promises] you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.” (1:4).  Peter is telling us that we can do with our calling in order to access the promises made by God for His glory and our benefit...</p>

<p>“For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brother kindness, love.”  (1: 5 – 7).  We are called to be an “elect” group of people living in a sin-filled world and by following Peter’s advice here we can live a life that is productive for the Kingdom of our Lord.  “For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1:8).</p>

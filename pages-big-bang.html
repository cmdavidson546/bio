        At the very outset, God created the heavens and the earth and all that is within them.  Genesis 1:1.  Accordingly, there are no independent (mathematical) laws of nature that can derive (a priori) from nothing, without accounting for a creation event, such that an external locus of control acted on the system. 
        
        Put simply, the builder brought the materials to the construction site at the time of building.  Prior to the builder's arrival, there was nothing, or at the least, absolutely no pathway to knowledge of events or circumstances, prior to the beginning of the building period.
        
        Thus, the fundamental laws of nature, as we know them, obey, and when discovered by mankind, testify to, God's "spoken" Order in the Universe.  Gen 1:1.
        
        Phsycists currently work backwards mathematically on the universe until they reach a singularity and stop to declare victory.  However, what happened prior to the hot dense singularity that produced the entirety of a seemingly (observable) infinite universe?  What caused the density for unknown times being stable prior to the big bang theory kicking in.  Thus, there is no way, without accounting for God creating ex nihlo (from nothing), to render a reasonable explanation (based on evidence presented in this work) for explaining existence, as we experience it.

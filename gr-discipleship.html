    Who was John the Baptist? The Archetype Christian


Matthew 3:1-5 tells us, “In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness  (or desert?) of Judea… John’s clothes were made of camel’s hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.  People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan.”  

Mark 1:4-7 gives us the same opening description of the prophet stating, “John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness…The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him…John wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey… And this was his message: “After me comes the one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.””  

Several interesting points to note here:
•	Historical: There was great social unrest at the time of John the Baptists’ ministry.  Roman military occupation, Herod’s extravagance and a change of governor in the region to Pilate in A.D. 26.
•	Location:  The word translation of eremos.  Even though it says “wilderness” in most translations, the traditional location of Jesus’ baptism was in Bethany across the Jordan (see Jn 1:28).  The Desert of Judea/Wilderness of Judea was an area that stretched around 20 miles from Jerusalem-Bethlaham plateau down to the Jordan River the Dead Sea.  The people of Qumran lived in this area too.  John also baptized at “Aenon near Salim” (Jn 3:23).
•	Qumran Community:  Often associated with the dead sea scrolls, the religious sect (Esssenes) from Qumran professed similar doctrines of repentance and baptism.  So it makes sense that John could have come from this “desert” region of the Jordan valley leading to the Dead Sea area.
•	Essenes:  Referred to by Josephus, the Essenes were a small, separatist group that grew out of the conflicts of the Maccabean revolution.  They stressed strict legal observance, buty they considered the temple priesthood corrupt and rejected much of the temple ritual and sacrificial system.  Their beliefs were unorthodox (belief in a war between Sons of Light and Sons of Darkness, Teacher of Rightousness, multiple Messiah’s, etc.).

John’s own viewpoint of himself was such that he thought himself unworthy of even knowing Jesus and touching his feet.

John 1:6 states, “There was a man sent from God whose name was John.”  Matthew 3:3, Mark 1:2-3, and Luke 3:4-6 state that John was the one “who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah: “A voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’” (Luke adds several other verses).

John the Baptist was the first disciple of the ministry of Jesus Christ and is a good starting point for describing one portrait of a man who dedicated his life to both faith and works, in the pursuit of God’s kingdom.  John (the Apostle) tells us that John (the Baptist) was “sent from God.”  Matthew describes John as a preacher who lived in the woods whom the people around the Jordan went out to see and hear preach.  The latter must have been written to demonstrate that John was out there preaching the truth of the Gospel (even before the Gospel was brought into the world!).  Both Matthew and Mark tell us about John’s appearance and how he most likely was relying solely on God for his provisions.

We can say that John felt a call on his life to do something for the glory of God.  Luke our historian, tells us, “In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar—when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene— during the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness.” Luke 3:1-2.

Here, we have an interesting phrase:  “the word of God came to John…in the wilderness.”  John first went into the wilderness to wait on the God of the Universe to call upon him for his purpose and in so doing was able to fulfill the purpose for which he had been created.  Notice how the Bible does not tell us that the word of God came to John and then we began preaching in the wilderness.  John was already in the wilderness when the word of God came to him.  John was likely following his heart to serve God, making his heart ready to receive God’s spirit, not knowing when that time would come or what it would look like. 

Rick Warren in his book, “The Purpose Driven Life” says, “Fortunately, there is an alternative to speculation about the meaning and purpose of life. It’s revelation.”   We do not need to wonder about what God has called us to do, but rather, it is built into our DNA and all we have to do to access it is to CHOOSE to seek God’s call for our lives.  This brings me to my first important “work” that must be undertaken in order to find the proper balance of being a Christian and ultimate of finding of salvation – exercising free will of human reason to seek God first in your life.  John the Baptist could have turned out much different if he had not made a choice at some point in his life to follow God.

We are given free will to choose God’s call or reject it.  John the Baptist must have felt a deep sense of longing to serve God in his life but the pulls and tugs of living in the world could have prevented him from fully realizing the power and glory that God wanted to deliver through him had he chosen to reserve a part of himself for living in the world.  He left his home and family to go out into the woods and seek revelation from the Lord of Heaven and at the appointed time.  God probably made such a revelation to him through John’s daily prayers and meditation on the scriptures, or maybe through an inner drive directed by the Holy Spirit in John’s heart, which thereafter shaped the way John acted for the rest of his life. 

However, John did not receive any clear-cut sign to “go out into the wilderness.”  John did not have an angel appear to him, or a messenger tell him, “Now is the time to move.”  We would have been told such information in the Gospel (just as we were told John’s parents received a message, Joseph received direct message, Mary, etc.).  Scripture tells us everything we need to know and John just knew that something was telling him to go.  A voice in his head, or whispering in his heart, maybe, which made him uncomfortable with his then-present life.  

John most likely was a religious man from the very beginning,  before his sojourn into the wilderness, based on the faith of his parents, who we are told were devout believers in God.  So, he was basing his faith off of the scriptures that he had with him at the time, to guide his purpose.  But, there is strong evidence to believe that John was no more connected to God than any one of us are today.  Indeed, Matthew 11:2-3 tells us that John had to ask Jesus himself if He was messiah: “When John, who was in prison, heard about the deeds of the Messiah, he sent his disciples to ask him, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?”  This story is re-iterated in Luke 7:19-22: “[John] sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?” When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?’” At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind.  So he replied to the messengers, “Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard…”

It seems that John was walking by faith alone when he went out into the wilderness to wait for God to call him.  John exercised his gift of free will with wisdom to choose to study the scriptures and prepare himself for use by God to bring glory to the God who had sent him into the world and to do God’s work.  John used discernment, reading the Word of God in the scriptures, and through diligent prayer and fasting, to learn what God asked of him and to find his purpose in this life.  In this way, all of scripture should be considered useful to the modern Christian, not just the New Testament scriptures.

So what is the doctrine of free will? [Look at Abraham’s life here???].  

A Google word search reveals the term “free will” to be defined as, “the power of acting without the constraint of necessity or fate; the ability to act at one's own discretion.”  Webster-Merriam defines the term “free will” as the, “freedom of humans to make choices that are not determined by prior causes or by divine intervention.”  So whether we are talking about “taking action” on the one hand (analogous to “working”) or “making choices” (analogous to “faith”), we are talking about some type of freedom in our thoughts and actions to make decisions for ourselves.  Rather than being told what to do, by either nature or a divine authority, we are born free.

According to the Evangelical Dictionary of Theology (pp. 467-468), “there are three basic positions concerning human choices:  determinism, indeterminism, and self-determination.” [NEED TO FINISH READING THIS…]

Let us assume, to the contrary, that we do not have free-will, such that we do not have the freedom to make choices and so our choices are determined by prior causes or by divine intervention.  

We start with the first case, namely, that all of our choices are determined by prior causes.  Since the time of Plato and Aristotle, scientists have attempted to investigate the nature of reality and human behavior and explain a priori causation of the observed nature of both phenomena.  In the Posterior Analytics, Aristotle places the following crucial condition on proper knowledge: we think we have knowledge of a thing only when we have grasped its cause (APost. 71 b 9–11. Cf. APost. 94 a 20).   Aristotle then expands on his investigation on causation by relying on the principle of the four causes:  (1) the material cause (“that out of which…”); (2) the formal cause (“the form”, “the account of what-it-is-to-be”); (3) the efficient cause (“the primary source of the change or rest”); and (4) the final cause (“the end, that for the sake of which a thing is done”).  These four causes were used by Aristotle to investigate the nature of reality that was observed.

For example, “If we ask what caused a house to exist, Aristotle would give you the following answers:

•	Material Cause: It is made of bricks and concrete.

•	Formal Cause: The bricks and concrete have been assembled so that a structure has emerged.

•	Efficient Cause: A builder put all its parts together.

•	Final Cause: Its function is to be a place where we can sleep and be warm.” 


	It is obvious that in order to explain human actions and behavior from a causality perspective, Aristotle provides no relevance to the inquiry because it fails to explain, as in the example above, why the builder decided to build the house in the first place (other than as a function of comfort).  Was the builder building because he was paid to build the house, or, maybe because he lost his previous home in a flood or fire that caused him to want to build a new house in order to rest and be warm?  Maybe the builder was motivated by altruistic thoughts that led him to build a house for the poor?

	Modern science attempts to explain causality of the natural world by looking at the known physical laws of our universe to explain natural phenomena.  In this way, they too are limited by the limits of human knowledge and the existence of the natural record which speaks to us from the past.  One writer writes, “One of the problems with causation is that the fundamental microscopic physics of the universe are time-symmetric: if you record the movements of particles and then play that recording backwards, it still makes sense and it still follows the usual laws of physics.  So it works just as well to play everything in reverse and ask, "is there anything that happens without a future cause"?  Of course, in our experience we see a clear difference between past and future (Arrow of time). While the physical origin of this observed difference is not indisputably resolved, the Second law of thermodynamics seems to be the ultimate reason for the difference, pointing out the future as the direction with the higher Entropy. In fact, entropy is the only known physical quantity that meaningfully distinguishes past from future. But there are processes that don't change entropy (to an approximation; called Isentropic processes), and furthermore, the entire universe could eventually reach a maximum of entropy in the hypothesized Heat death of the universe. In these situations, it becomes impossible to tell past and future apart in any meaningful way (see CPT symmetry and CP violation for "non-meaningful").  Arguably then, if causation is not time-symmetric and you can't talk about something being caused by the future, causation must be related to entropy, and it must be undefined during isentropic processes.  There are some modern attempts to define causation in quantitative statistical terms (Causal Processes, Probabilistic Causation), where, as we'd expect, an isentropic process doesn't create any of the statistical differences between past and future that we need to define causation. For example, fire in the past is highly correlated with ashes in the future, and therefore we say that fire causes ashes.” 

	Here we would have to define the actions and behaviors of humans in terms of a probability curve, with each decision being made based on the probability of its consequences.  “Modern nuclear physics tells us that the matter of every thing can ultimately and theoretically be converted into energy, and energy can similarly be converted into matter. Nevertheless, there still seems to be some principle that underlies each of these two ways of being physical but cannot exist without being one or the other, matter or energy. Thus, it seems that we still have a theoretical need for the notion of prime matter.”

	Work #1 of Christian:  Making a CHOICE to follow God. Let God do the work, while you exercise the special gift of free will to choose to serve God first and foremost in your life – read the Bible, pray daily, fast regularly, do good to others even when they do not do good to you, do not lie, slander or cast curses onto your fellow human beings – and God will deliver you from the original sin AND direct you to your purpose through clear insightful messages directed specifically to you – using particular Scripture readings, or the inner voice each of us has through the work of the Holy Spirit in our hearts, or even through interactions with other Christians! – all based on your choice to serve God in your life rather than world.  Sometimes this message for your purpose is immediate and direct (e.g., accept God into your heart; next day win lotto; the day after that you open up a free hospital in honor of God to help the poor, the sick and the lame) or sometimes this message takes generations (e.g., Abraham left Ur and traveled throughout the area for many years following his inner voice about what God was directing him for and was rewarded by his faith – a reward that continues to bear fruit to this day).


John’s message: Repentance.

Once the choice to follow God is made, there is a necessary condition that must be implemented in order to activate the rule of God in one’s life and to obtain salvation.

Mark 1:4 And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 5 The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.” 

Matthew 3:1 “In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea 2 and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.”…6 Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. 7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them: “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 8 Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. 9 And do not think you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. 10 The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. 

Luke 3:7 John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 8 Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. 9 The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”

In Mark, Luke and Matthew we see the same phrases repeated, namely, “Repent,” “Confess,” and “Good Fruit.”  What do these phrases mean?

In Luke 3 we read some interesting dialogue:

10 “What should we do then?” the crowd asked.

11 John answered, “Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same.”

12 Even tax collectors came to be baptized. “Teacher,” they asked, “what should we do?”

13 “Don’t collect any more than you are required to,” he told them.

14 Then some soldiers asked him, “And what should we do?”
He replied, “Don’t extort money and don’t accuse people falsely—be content with your pay.”

To repent 

Work #2: Repent in your heart, confess your sins and produce good fruit in keeping with repentance.

Repentance is more than a confession of sins.  It is a “turning away” from the things that offend God.  It is a commitment to following the ways of Jesus Christ who lived a life as an example to those who God calls as His own.  When we confess our sins we are merely acknowledging our sinful nature and our need for a savior in Jesus Christ.  But, when we repent a true repentance in our hearts, we are acting out that confession in our behavior such that we are being a light in the dark world to demonstrate (fruit) of our salvation in Jesus Christ.  It is not a call to be perfect and the cycle of confession and repentance will continue throughout one’s life.  However, repentance is a lifestyle change in so far as we are oftentimes going against what our flesh is telling us to do in order to abide in God’s spirit which lives in us to turn toward God. In order to have repentant fruit in our lives we must do two things: (1) trust in God that His ways are better than our ways and (2) trust that the Holy Spirit is leading us toward that way in which God is calling us.


What was John the Baptist’s purpose in life?  The same purpose as all of us: Baptize in the name of Jesus Christ and proclaim the Good News

John 1:7-8 says, “He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe. He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.”  Matthew 3:3 tells us this about John:  “This [John] is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah:  “A voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’” Luke 3:3-6 says, “He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: “A voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.  Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth.  And all people will see God’s salvation.’”

Luke 3:15 The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah. 16 John answered them all, “I baptize you with[b] water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with[c] the Holy Spirit and fire. 17 His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” 18 And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them. 

Mark 1:7-8 says, “And this was his message: “After me comes the one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.  I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.””

John’s purpose in life was singular…as is the case for all of us.  John’s purpose was to serve God and to bring glory to His kingdom in heaven by his testimony here on Earth.  In particular, he was put on earth to “prepare the way” for Jesus, softening the hearts and minds of those people in the Jordan River valley who were desparately seeking answers to why God had seemingly abandoned them to the Roman government (and before that Epiphanes IV?? Who the Macabees fought). (HISTORY LESSON HERE???).  Once John committed his heart and life to God, he was then available to be used by God for the purposes that God had designed him for.  In this way, John was able to become 100% of who he was meant to be through the combined power of God AND his free-will choice to follow God.

In Luke 7:24-30 we read, “Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?  If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.  But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written: “‘I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.’ I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”

And in Matthew 11:7-15, “Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?  If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings’ palaces. Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.  This is the one about whom it is written: “‘I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.’ Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence,[d] and violent people have been raiding it. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John. And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come. Whoever has ears, let them hear.”

In the end, all that matters is what Jesus thinks of us and whether He approves of our lives and our testimony of truth to the world around us.  Jesus ties John’s life to the prophets listed in the Old Testament and I believe John read those scriptures as a young man, prayed to God to give him his purpose in life, and was answered in prayer as God spoke to his heart silently.   Is this to say that everyone who reads the Bible and prays will become a prophet?  Of course not!  We are told that each one of us has certain gifts that God has endowed us with in order to further the truth that God wants to be known in the world.  Unfortunately, Satan acts to block that truth from coming into the world and most of us let Satan win.  But, in God’s divine plan for all of us, He has selected each of us for works that would, when taken together, lead to a peaceful harmony in the world.  Maybe some of us would be called to preach, others to teach, others to manage, others to serve, and still others to do whatever God leads them to do through their faith.  But, the call begins with seeking God in your own life first and foremost and be willing to give up everything when that call comes to you to serve.

It is true that John’s purpose was to “prepare the way” for Jesus, but, if we could pinpoint John’s purpose down to even a single event it would be this:  He was sent to this world to prepare the way for the Lord through baptism in order to cleanse the people and prepare their hearts for the ministry of Jesus.  Even more specifically, John would ultimately be used to baptize God himself in human flesh when he declared, “The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is the one I meant when I said, ‘A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’  I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.” (John 1:29-31).  Thus, John knew his role because God had revealed it to him through John’s diligence in following God’s purpose for his life.

	John’s study of the scripture led him to believe he was the one spoken about in the Old Testament scriptures.  His faith in God was strong and was humble enough to know his role in the grand design of God’s plan.  This is evidenced by his dealings with those in power.  In John 1:19-28, we read, “…when the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.  He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, “I am not the Messiah.” They asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.”  [They asked,] “Are you the Prophet?”  He answered, “No.”  Finally they said, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”  John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, “I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way for the Lord.’”  Now the Pharisees who had been sent questioned him, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”  [He replied,] “I baptize with water,” John replied, “but among you stands one you do not know.  He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.”  This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.”

	John’s purpose was given to him by God.  I argue that this was not through any messenger sent directly by God, but rather, by John’s exercise of free will to follow God in his life and then God delivered his messages through scripture, the Holy Spirit and other (pre) Christians.  John 1:32-34 tells us, “Then John gave this testimony: “I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him [Jesus]. And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’  I have seen and I testify that this is God’s Chosen One.”  


	In Matthew 3:13-17, we read, “Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.  But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”  Jesus replied, “Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John consented.  As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.  And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”  

This statement seems to contradict the order of events.  If John knew that the one on whom the Dove descended upon was the Messiah, then how did he know Jesus was the Messiah before he baptized him?  Both of the authors here were disciples of Jesus, but since John was said to be at the baptism of Jesus and Matthew was not, it is plausible to think that the repertoire between John and Jesus prior to Jesus being baptized was a later addition to the scriptures due to the reverence for Jesus that came about after His resurrection.

	Mark 1:9-11, tells us, “At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.  Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.  And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.” And, in Luke 3:21-22 states, “When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.”  Since, three of the four Gospels do not relate the conversation between John and Jesus prior to his baptism, it is likely that the conversation did not happen.  What is most probable is that John was baptizing thousands of people, and Jesus immediately stood out as being pure to John, who, after baptizing Jesus, recognized him as the Son of God by the revlealation of the dove.  Again, all the evidence points to the fact that John was not visited by a messenger directly, but rather was walking by faith alone when he went into the woods to baptize the people of Israel.  Further evidence that John could not have known Jesus was the Messiah is given by the fact that while John was in prison, he sent his messengers to ask Jesus directly about his position.

	So, what is Baptism and is it necessary for the modern Christian?

	John’s purpose was to Baptize the people of Israel, to prepare them for the coming of God on earth, and then to baptize Jesus himself in order to mark the starting point of Jesus’ ministry.  John 3:22-26 says, “After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized.  Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were coming and being baptized.  (This was before John was put in prison.)  An argument developed between some of John’s disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing.  They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan—the one you testified about—look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.”  To this John replied, “A person can receive only what is given them from heaven. You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him.’  The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete.  He must become greater; I must become less.”  The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all.  He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony.  Whoever has accepted it has certified that God is truthful.  For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God[i] gives the Spirit without limit.  The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands.  Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them.”

	Here, we read that after being baptized himself, Jesus was also baptizing others as well.  This is important and holds the key for modern Christians as to whether Baptism is necessary for us to enter into the salvation agreement with God.

Work #3: Baptism.

Jesus says that baptism was necessary for Him so that all righteousness can be fulfilled.

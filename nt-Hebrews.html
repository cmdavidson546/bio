  <h1>New Testament Commentary</h1>

    <h2>Letter to the Hebrews</h2>

    <h4>Introduction to the letter</h4>

    <hr>

    <h4>Hebrews 1, 2, 3</h4>

<p>The Zondervan Introduction states that the author is unknown, but there is some evidence that (a) it was written prior to the destruction of the Temple in 70AD and (b) the author could have either been Barnabas or Apollos (both were Jewish Christians).</p>

<p>The Zondervan Introduction tells us the theme of the letter is to argue (against Judaizers) the absolute supremacy and sufficiency of Jesus Christ as the mediator of God’s Grace upon humanity, that Christ fulfilled the OT prophecies and promises, and that Christ is superior to the ancient prophets, angels, and even Moses and Aaron and the priestly succession descended from them.</p>

<p>The author employs expositions of 8 specific OT passages.  Exposition is the insertion of background information into a narrative to fully explain an idea.  Here we see it occur 8 times:</p>
<ol>
<li>2:5-9; Exposition of Ps 8:4-6</li>
<li>3:7 – 4:13; Exposition of Ps 95:7-11</li>
<li>4:14 – 7:28; Exposition of Ps 110:4</li>
<li>8:1 – 10:18; Exposition of Jer 31:31-34</li>
<li>10:1 – 10; Exposition of Ps 40:6-8</li>
<li>10:32 – 12:3; Exposition of Hab 2:3-4</li>
<li>12:4 – 13; Exposition of Pr 3:11-12</li>
<li>12:18-24; Exposition of Ex 19:10-23</li>
</ol>
<p>The author emphasizes that there can be no turning back to the OT Jewish system because it has been superseded by the unique priesthood of Christ.</p>

<p>In Chapter 3, the author warns the believers not to go astray as the Israelites did in the 40 years of wandering in the wilderness, “See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving hear thtat turns away from the living God.” Otherwise, just like them, “they were not able to enter [God’s Rest], because of their unbelief.”</p>

<hr>
<h4>Hebrews 4, 5, 6</h4>

<p>The writer of Hebrews begins chapter 4 with a simple thought: Just like the Israelites who did not enter the Promised Land (e.g., God’s Rest) because of their disobedience, so too will a Christian not enter Eternal Peace (e.g., God’s Rest) in the same manner.  “Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it. 2 For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed.”  Thus, the foundational requirement to enter God’s Rest is faith, from which obedience flows.</p>

<p>In Chapter 5 we read about the High Priesthood of Jesus Christ, who was called by God, to represent the believer in matters related to God. (5:1).  The author tells us, “Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek.” (5:8-10).</p>

<p>But, we must not be fooled and we must not fall away if we are to see God’s Rest!  If we are truly saved, we must be growing into maturity and in chapter 6 we read about the “foundations of our faith” and “elementary” teachings about Christ, and are called to move beyond the foundations so that we can be of some use to the Kingdom.  The foundations are laid out in 6:1-2 as, “repentance from acts that lead to death, and of faith in God, instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.”</p>

<p>Chapter 6:4-6 says that it is impossible for a believer who has shared in the enlightenment of God and the Holy Spirit to fall away and come back into repentance, “because to their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace.”  There are several explanations to this verse: 1. It talks only to the Hebrew Christian; 2. it talks to all Christians who lose their salvation once; 3. it is a hypothetical argument to warn immature believers that they must progress toward maturity or face the wrath of God as the Israelites did who did not get to see the Promised Land; or 4. it talks to professing Christians whose public apostacy proves their faith was not genuine.</p>

<h4>Hebrews 7, 8, 9</h4>

<p>Hebrews 7 makes an interesting comparison of Melchizedek (Gen 14: 18 – 20) to a pre-configuration of Christ in the OT.  Melchizedek has no genealogy, unlike the other great OT characters, and the author of Hebrews tells us, “Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God, he remains a priest forever.” (7:3).</p>

<p>The Levitical priesthood through the line of Aaron was so flawed in implementing the Law, coming after Melchizedek, but yet even the priest of Levi required a tenth from the people, as required by the Law.  So, the fact that Abraham gave Melchizedek a tenth of his plunder, and Melchizedek blesses Abraham, the man of the promise, shows us that God had created a separate and perfect priestly line, before Aaron and Levi, in Melchizedek.  Hebrews tells us that Christ fulfills this other priestly lineage as the priest to come in Ps 110:4 (written mid-way through the Levitical priesthood historically), which states, “You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.”</p>

<p>“For when there is a change of the priesthood, there must also be a change of the law.” (7:12).  Because Jesus lives forever, and fulfills the role of eternal priest, he also brings with it a New Covenant that transcends the old law because His priesthood is above the priesthood of the line of Aaron.  “Therefore, he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.  Such a high priest meets our need – one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens.” (7:25-26)</p>

<p>The New Covenant is repeated in Chapter 8 of Hebrews, which quotes it out of Jeremiah 31:31 -34:  “The time is coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel...”</p>

<hr>
<h4>Hebrews 10, 11</h4>

<p>The author begins chapter 10 by stating that the “law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming – not he realities themselves” and that for this reason, it could never make the believer perfect through sacrifice under the law because it must be made year after year after year, by the High Priest.</p>

<p>But, Jesus, coming as the High Priest of the New Covenant, and who sat down at the right hand of the Father after His sacrifice was made, completed the law in that, by the will of the Father, “we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.” (10:10).</p>

<p>It has been the will of the Father all along, as was stated in Jeremiah 31:33 – 34:</p>

<p>“This is the covenant I will make with them</p>
<p>after that time, says the Lord.</p>
<p>I will put my laws in their hearts,</p>
<p>and I will write them on their minds.”</p>

<p>Then, he adds in verse 34:</p>

<p>“Their sins and lawless acts</p>
<p>I will remember no more.”</p>

<p>We, as followers of Jesus Christ, no longer need a High Priest to atone for us in the Most Holy of Places in a physical Temple every year for our sins.  The author calls the Christian believers to “draw near to God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith” because we now may ourselves “enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body...” (10:19 – 22).
Therefore, the author gives some advice as to how to have a “clear conscience” as we enter the Holy Place to be with our God (10:23 – 25, “let us”):  (1) “hold unswervingly to the hope we profess”; (2) “consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds”; (3) to “not give up meeting together”; (4) “encourage one another”.</p>

<p>Here is a faithful warning from the author: “If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, but only a fearful expectation of judgement and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.” (10:27).</p>

<p>In chapter 11 we first read the definition of faith, which is then colored by numerous examples of people of the OT who were credited by their faith. “Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.” (11:1).  The author lists several examples such as Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, Rahab, Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the Prophets.  One thing they all had in common was that they “were still living by faith when they died. [but] They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance.” (11:13).  Therefore, “Without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.” (11:6).</p>

<h4>Hebrews 12, 13</h4>

<p>In chapter 12, we learn that God disciplines His Sons.  Speaking of the character of the men of faith that were written about in chapter 11, the author opens chapter 12 with an exhortation to “run the good race.”  “Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.  Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.  Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.” (12:1 – 3).</p>

<p>Here is a faithful saying: “In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.” (12:4).  So, therefore, take heart that you are not dead in your sin AND because of your sins against God.  God, in His Perfect Holiness, should by all right, blot us out like a stain on His perfect Robe of Justice.  But, He does not.  Instead, God treats us as Sons, which sometimes requires discipline as Proverb 3:11-12 tells us, “My son, do not make light of the Lord’s discipline, and do not lose heart when he rebukes you, because the Lord disciplines those he loves, and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son.”</p>

<p>However, the treatment of God’s Sonship does not last forever for those who continue to ignore (or “make light of”) the discipline of the Lord on their lives.  Therefore, the author of Hebrews tells us, “Make every effort to live in peace with all men and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord.  See to it that...no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many.  See that no one is sexually immoral or is godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son.  Afterward...when he wanted to inherit this blessing, he was rejected.  He could bring about no change of mind, though he sought the blessing with tears.” (12:14 – 17).</p>

<p>The author leaves us in Chapter 13 with some exhortations: “Keep on loving each other as brothers.  Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing it.  Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering.  Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.  Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have...” (13:1 – 5).</p>

<p>“Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings.” (13:9).</p>

<p>“Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise – the fruit of the lips that confess his name.  And do not forget to do good and to share with other, for with such sacrifices God is please.” (13:15-16).</p>

<p>“Obey your leaders and submit to their authority.” (13:17).</p>

<p>“Pray for us [the ministers of the Word of God].” (13:18).</p>

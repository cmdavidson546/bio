    <h1>On the Proof of God: The Golden Ratio</h1>
    <h4>Preface</h4>
    <p>Here are the questions this essay will seek to examine in detail:</p>
    <p>(I) The single most important question for all of humanity over the years has been whether or not God exists?  And if so, in what form does God exist?  And, further, what is the relationship between God and Man?  This question has occupied the minds of the world’s greatest thinkers since the written record began.  It still does today despite the modern trends towards removing God from the public sphere in the West.  In the Eastern half of the globe, however, there is a spiritual war raging in the hearts and minds of the populace.  Therefore, the question is very much alive today every bit as much as it was for the past 5000 years of human history.</p>
    
    <p>(a) Let us first assume that God does not exist and humanity is simply the creation of the natural order (Darwin, Evolution).  The natural world decays and renews itself through a natural process.  Life adapts.  Nature regenerates itself and thus is finite in time but eternal in nature since the life which it brings forth is regenerative.</p>
    
    <p>(b) Let us now assume that God does indeed exist. Let us consider such existence in terms of an eternal time period.  If God does not exist, then nature by itself must be finite since it has a beginning and an end in the eternal time line of God.  But how can a finite life form contemplate an eternal existence?</p>
    
    <p>(II) Let us next consider whether God is One or many</p>
    
    <p>(a) If God is many, then how could many spring forth spontaneously without having a single point of origin?  Would there not need to be a first principle God who would have been first out of many?</p>
    
    <p>(b) What if God is One?  Then how can Christianity have the trinity?  Just as I, a mere human being, can be a Father to my children, a Son to my parents and a husband to my wife, does it not make sense that a God who created the Universe could also be a Father to Creation, a Son of Mankind and a Spirit that is united to the Creation through some formal divine union of spirit?</p>
    
    <p>(III) Let us lastly, for the purposes of rendering purpose to this essay, consider the nature of good and evil and of free will and what our responsibilities are in the gray areas of life that will lead us to a life well lived and eternal life.</p>
    
    <p>(a) To those not willing to accept the existence of God, it is said he does not exist because of evil in the world.  They say, God can only be “all good” and not “all powerful” OR God can be “all powerful” and not “all good” because of the evil that exists in reality.  This imports the basic humanistic principle that power corrupts a man absolutely and that even good men, who attain total power, use it for their own gain.  However, unfortunately, this also does not consider the basic human condition of original sin, which dictates that men are separated from God by their sin condition and thus are not of the same thinking as God.</p>
    
    <p>(b) Original sin caused a massive upheaval in the social order between men and God.  Our natural inclination is to be selfish and to love ourselves above our neighbors.  But, free-will was a gift given to us to choose to have faith in an unseen God, to separate the wheat from the chaff, and thus separate us from the angels who do not have free will. Evil exists because of man's sin and their freedom to choose to do such evil... not because God is operating with mal intent in the world around us.  God allows evil to allow free will to allow choice.  God does not want or need puppets who do his Will during their life only because we are "made" to do so.</p>

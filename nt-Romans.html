    <h2>The Book of Romans</h2>
    

    <h4>Romans 1, 2, 3</h4>
    <p>During Paul's travels in the Book of Acts he wrote letters to the fledgling churches that were sprouting up around the Mediteranean.  For fans of history, you will find it interesting that the "books" we have today in the New Testament are the actual letters Paul wrote to those  churches - Galatians (written 49/50 AD), 1 Thessalonians (51 AD), 2 Thessalonians (52 AD), 1 Corinthians (55 AD), 2 Corinthians (55 AD), Romans (57 AD), Ephesians (60 AD), Colossians (60 AD), Philemon (60 AD), Philippians (61 AD), 1 Timothy (63-65 AD), Titus (63-65 AD), and 2 Timothy (67/68 AD).</p>
    <p>The Book of Romans is the first of these letters that the New Testament throws at us after the Book of Acts.  In chapter 1 Paul lays out the indictment against humanity showing how a world apart from God has and always will descend into choas and wrong thinking.  Romans 1: "18 The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, 19 since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them...21 For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools..."</p>
    <p>The beauty of Christianity is there are no "hidden" secrets.  There is no "mystery" or "mystical" practices that lead to salvation and eternal life.  God would be "unjust" if that were so.  The same exact story that was told the day after Jesus was raised from the dead is the same exact story that we read in the Gospels 2000 years later.  In direct contradiction to the Word of God, the Catholics by their papal decrees, Mormons by the teachings of Joseph Smith, or even the maniacs like the guys from Waco or Jonestown... all tell you that you need something "more than faith in Jesus" to be saved.  They all claim to hold some "secret" message or "special" mandate to the path towards God.  These claims are all blatant lies.  Read the first 4 books of the New Testament (the "Gospels") for yourselves and compare the teachings of Jesus with the practices of these  institutions and I am sure God will lead you to the correct conclusion.</p>
    <p>Paul tells us in Romans 3 how to be a faithful Christian:  "23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. 25 God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished— 26 he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus."  </p>

    <h4>Romans 4, 5, 6</h4>
    <p>Faith vs. Works...an age old question. It was THE question of the Protestant Reformation causing, for the first time in over 1000 years, a break from the "Catholic" Church theology. The word "Catholic" is simply the latin word for "Universal". The Eastern Orthodox Church split off before the Protestants and claimed to be the true continuation of the original "Catholic" (Universal) Church. Either way, before the Protestant Reformation, all forms of the "Universal" Christian Church taught that man's "Works" produced salvation (e.g., one had to do good things and prove their worth through human endeavor in order to obtain eternal life with God).</p>
    <p>But, most of you should know the story, in 1517 Martin Luther tacked some paperwork on a Catholic Church door letting them know how wrong they were and thereafter the Protestant Reformation was born. The Protestant Reformation's premise was that a person can only be saved by "Faith" and not "Works". Good "Works" were just a byproduct of a saving "Faith". Luther's theology (in my opinion) accords with the teachings of Christ in the Gospel. Paul would concur with Luther, as he states in Romans 4:</p>
    <p>"2 If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he [would have] had something to boast about - but not before God. 3 What does the Scripture say? 'Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as rigteousness.'... 13 It was not through law [e.g., Works] that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith... 23 The words 'it was credited to him' were written not for him alone, 24 but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness - for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. 25 He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification."</p>
    <p>Therefore, Salvation is a GIFT from God and not something we can ever EARN through our own works in this life. Jesus came, as an innocent man and was killed for teaching the Truth. This death penalty was required because God is Holy and His Holiness requires the complete absence of sin for anyone to hope to stand in His presence one day. Man could never do enough to make himself Holy enough to stand before God at the end of our lifetimes. So, Jesus had to die and be raised from the dead, pay the penalty for the sinful nature that is within all of us, in order to cleanse us of all unrighteousness by our "faith" in that Truth. Here lies the simplicity of Christianity, namely, all we need to do is believe that Jesus died for our sins and was raised from the dead and such faith in Him will be credited to us in the end as righteousness. It is our faith and not our works that will allow us to stand before a Holy and Rigtheous God one day.</p>

    <h4>Romans 7, 8, 9</h4>
    <p>Here we find some of Paul's most famous words. Most of you have probably seen a lot of these passages stitched on a pillow, or hanging on a frame, or printed on cards somewhere.</p>
    <p>Romans 8 "28 And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose...38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."</p>
    <p>I urge you to read through these chapters and find the promises of God to be true in your own life.</p>

    <h4>Romans 10, 11, 12</h4>
    <p>It always has amazed me that people say they don't believe in God.  Our unbelief and pride are the reasons why our world is coming apart at the seams. It is not in our nature to be kind, gentle and forgiving.  For those who are rejecting God right now, listen to what you are standing "against", and then compare what is happening in the world around us:</p>
    <p>Rom 12: "9 Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. 10 Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves. 11 Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. 12 Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. 13 Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality.</p>
    <p>14 Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. 15 Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn. 16 Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited.</p>
    <p>17 Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. 18 If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. 19 Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord. 20 On the contrary:</p>
    <p>“If your enemy is hungry, feed him;</p>
    <p>if he is thirsty, give him something to drink.</p>
    <p>In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.”</p>
    <p>21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."</p>
    <p>This is what you are rejecting right now?  And then you are surprised at what is happening all around us in this country?  All that God asks from us is that we believe in His Son Jesus...nothing more.  And yet, we, as a nation, have rejected and removed Jesus from every aspect of our public lives.  Why?  Because some scientist or politiican or pedophile media mogul makes fun of it on TV or in a news article?!  It has had disastrous results listening to these fools and it is becoming more clearer by the day that they have absolutely no idea what they are talking about.</p>
    <p>No one is saying that we should form a Christian Theocracy.  Separation of Church and State is a good thing because we would just muck up the governance under the mandate of God and dishonor God by abusing any power given to us in any event.  Such is our nature...given a little power in life most people will abuse it.  This police officer's actions in MN is just the most recent example.  But, give God His due credit in the public sphere and honor Him with the way we live everyday and He will bestow blessing upon blessing on us as a nation as His people.</p>
    <p>So, listen to the GOOD NEWS!  Rom 10:4 says, "Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes...9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. 11 As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.”...13 for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”</p>
    <p>And in Rom 10 we read, "14 How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? 15 And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!” 16 But not all... accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?” 17 Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ."</p>

    <h4>Romans 13, 14, 15, 16</h4>
    <p>Paul was unjustly beaten, imprisoned and ultimately murdered by the Roman authorities for nothing more than preaching the Gospel to others.  But, he had a deep and abiding faith that God was in control of all things including civil government.  Since God has ordained all government and has made all things, Paul praises the same government that persecuted him unto death, and shows us what our role should be in the order of things - namely, to obey authority and to love one another as Christ loves us.  If we are mistreated or abused by the authorities of our day, I urge you to think of Paul's message here in Romans 13, and keep in mind this is the same authority that persecuted him everywhere he went.  We must remember that "vengence" is not ours to dole out as Christians.  We are called to pray and love our enemies in order to show a sinful world that there is a different way - God's Way - that brings light to the darkness.  Thank you Lord for giving us a timely message this morning in Paul's words and in Your Wisdom on how to deal with the face of injustice in this dark, dark world.</p>
    
    <p>Romans 13: "1 Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 2 Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. 3 For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. 4 For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 5 Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience."</p>
    
    <p>"8 Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law. 9 The commandments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not covet,”[a] and whatever other command there may be, are summed up in this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”[b] 10 Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law."</p>
    
    <p>"11 And do this, understanding the present time: The hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. 12 The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. 13 Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy. 14 Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh."</p>

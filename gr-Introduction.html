    <h1>The Golden Ratio</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

        Have you ever seen a cartoon where the main character is on some type of boat or ship, and the hull of the ship starts leaking, and the main character starts using his body to plug up the leaks to prevent the ship from sinking? </p>

        <p>Sin is a lot like this in our lives.  Because our hearts are dark from birth (original sin, fall of mankind, total separation from God without salvation and sanctification or direct intervention by God) and our ignorance of reality (and the fallen condition of it), foolishly let us believe that we can navigate the dark waters of the deep oceans (life) without eventually sinking.</p>
        
        <p>As we get older, we quickly realize that perfection is off the table.  NO person is perfect. </p>

        <p>First, we must define perfection.  Biblically speaking, in Old Testament days, perfection would mean obeying the Law, since a majority age (CHECK THIS, 13?), without transgression in any way.  There is no example of this in the Old Testament.  This led to the idea of “righteousness,” which was a term used by the ancient Israelites (through the story of Abraham) to describe someone with a unwavering “faith” in God, trusting in His commands and obeying completely, but with some faults along the way, moments of the human condition that cannot be avoided.  Weakness.  Something less than perfect.  In the New Testament however, perfection is achieved when a person humbles himself to the point of showing genuine (agape) is achieved when a person can have love in his heart for even his enemy.  Only one person has demonstrated this in person, and this book is devoted to him.  His name is Jesus Christ.  In this man/God, this Christ Jesus, this Messiah, made some very plain and simple statements about Love.</p>
        
        <p>Just thing about your best day ever where you acted at your very best.  Did you cut someone off that day on your way to your thing (work, life event, party), did you do something, anything, that could have directly or proximately hurt someone’s feelings (Law, Old Testament obligations)?  Did you think any bad thoughts that day? (Jesus, New Testament obligations)?</p>

        <p>Ok, so that is your best day.  Now think about your worst day.  Where you really hurt someone.  We’ve all been there…so no judgement.</p>

        <p>So, we begin to acquiesce to our emotions, our culture, our thoughts, which leads to compromise with the absolute perfection of existence.  We reason, if we can’t be perfect, what then shall we compromise on?</p>

        <p>For some it is seemingly innocent – slandering and gossiping or the like.  For others, with bigger appetites for pleasure – sexual immorality, greed for power and money.  In either case, we move to something less than perfect in route to our goals in life, and we begin to take on a few “leaks” in our boat along the route through the consequences of our accumulated sins.</p>
        
        <p>At first, we believe, like the cartoon character, that we plug up those leaks using our own powers of reason and thought.  But, however, as we will see, the heart is dark beyond measure, and it will ultimately fail to rid the mind, body and soul of the darkness, because darkness cannot stamp out darkness, only the light can extinguish the darkness.</p>

        <p>So, in our feeble attempts, we begin to start plugging up the holes that sin has caused in our life.  We may stop smoking, but then we start binge eating.  We may stop committing murders but go on to sell and use drugs.  In every way, because our hearts START from the premise of darkness, no matter what we, on our own, try to do to stop the darkness from reaching the outside world (in the form of behavior), it fails because the darkness begins from within us.</p>

        <p>How do we then rid ourselves of the darkness?  And, importantly, since we cannot be perfect, how do we minimize the “leaks” so as to not sink into the darkness of our hearts?  For this, only the light can vanquish the dark and so the Bible teaches us that Jesus is the light of this world.  We must understand what it means to allow Jesus to enter our hearts and perform the miracle that God gave us, in Mercy, to extinguish the darkness from our hearts and allow us to walk in the light.</p>

        <p>There is a golden ratio, of faith and works, that God is looking for in his “good and faithful servants.”  Matthew 25:21.

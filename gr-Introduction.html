    <h1>On the Proof of God: The Golden Ratio</h1>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    
    <h4>I.	Introductory Comments:</h4>
    <p>At the outset, several assumptions need to be made in order to fit the theology of the book into a comprehensive whole:  (1) Jesus Christ was, is and always will be, the living Son of God and was at one time fully human and fully divine during the period of His ministry; (2) We do not know the full extent of Jesus’ personality before His ministry began because it is not fundamental to our salvation.  We know enough to have the faith required by God; (3) Jesus performed miraculous signs to demonstrate His authority during His ministry on earth; (4) Jesus was born into the World to model behavior and attitude that is pleasing to the God who created the entire landscape of reality (the Universe) and to offer himself as a sacrifice to atone for the sins of all mankind so that humanity, through faith in Him, can be justified for salvation in the eyes of God; (5) Faith in Jesus provides a pathway to God that is befitting a Holy and Just God who is at one time both unknowable and relational to His Creation but requires Holiness in His presence, which can only be achieved through faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
    
    <h4>II.	The Introduction of Jesus in the Gospel – varying points of view - all leading to the same conclusion:</h4>
    <p>Our Introduction to Jesus in the Gospels comes from the introductions given to us by the Gospel writers, who are Luke, Matthew, John and Mark.  Interestingly, each Gospel hands down a different opening, which indicates the “intent” of each author in relating the truth of the Gospel to its intended audience.</p>
    <p>Here, we see that Luke 1:1-3, who was writing for the benefit of the (Greek audiences), was a historian and by his own admission states from the outset, <em>“Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled[a] among us, 2 just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 3 With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you…”</em>Luke therefore states in plain words that he used both oral and written testimonies to the ministry of Jesus Christ in order to write his Gospel.</p>
    <p>Luke himself was not a witness, but rather a collector of data and evidence who believed in what he heard and saw from the people who were eye witnesses to the ministry of Jesus.  Therefore, just as in Courts across the country today, eyewitness testimony, was used as a reference point to which Luke’s search for the truth was taken.  </p>
    <p>It is hard to believe that where our current system of “justice” is heavily based on eyewitness testimony so that juries can evaluate the authenticity and credibility of a witness, that Luke, a physician and author of both a Gospel and the Book of Acts, could not make credible evaluations of what he was writing about in his time.  Like any good juror, Luke was charged with investigating the truth.  We know that he was a companion of Paul, so therefore, Luke lived during the time of Jesus and was alive during his ministry before he became a Christian.  </p>
    <p>Being an eyewitness to Paul’s mission meant that Luke most likely saw miraculous changes in the world around him that effected his belief in the truth.  And, again, just like in courts today that investigate the truth, Luke had personal knowledge to base his faith on.  Luke’s careful use of dates and historical facts of significance litter his story in the way that a good accurate historian would do in order to provide future readers historical landmarks to which we can rely on the veracity of his writings.</p>
    <p>Matthew, on the other hand, introduces Jesus in a much different way.  Matthew begins with the genealogies of Jesus.  The reason for this is because Matthew was writing to a Jewish audience.  The distinction between Matthew and Luke is that Matthew was an Apostle of Jesus Christ and therefore an eyewitness to the Lord’s ministry on earth.  This direct experience on earth by a human being to the glory of God in the flesh must have had a profound influence on the man we know as Matthew the tax collector.  We know Matthew left his profession (reviled by those whom he lived with) and followed a traveling preacher around Israel based on faith.  </p>
    <p>Luke also gives an account of the genealogies (Luke 3:23-28) (probably due to the fact that Luke was using all written sources available at the time and a version of Matthew or “Q” may have been circulating then).  But Luke’s and Matthew’s genealogies are slightly different…why? (see p.173-174 in Lea & Black).</p>
    <p>Matthew was writing as a Jew and to the Jewish populations to convince them that they were witnesses to the ancient promises they had so desperately been seeking in the Messiah.  Matthew obviously knew that their own suspicious hearts had led them astray and was attempting to appeal to their intellectual nature through use of theological arguments.  Therefore, unlike Luke, who was more concerned with gathering data and reporting it as a comprehensive whole, Matthew was making an appeal, an argument of sorts, that through this story of Jesus, it is painfully obvious that Jesus was the promised Messiah that would come through the line of David, their beloved King.  The Jews were expecting a messiah that would rule over them in the here and now, a messiah that was going to vanquish the enemies of Israel on the spot when he arrived and Jesus did not do what they were expecting him to do during his ministry.  Matthew’s argument needed to convince a Jewish national jury that what they had expected and what was actually happening were one and the same – God’s promise to deliver His people from sin and the trappings of this world.</p>
    <p>Like a good prosecutor, Matthew lays out his case for the truth.  He weaves in and out of the Jewish theological concepts and the practical accounts of what he himself was a witness to.  Interspersed through it all, Matthew paints the picture that the ancient Jewish texts have been fulfilled through the work of the Messiah in Jesus Christ.  He begins the story with showing that Jesus was, a priori, qualified under Jewish law to be a Messiah.  As we will see in this book, Matthew also shows that Jesus’ message is in line with the whole of the Jewish idea of a Messiah, but the message was radical and so misunderstood by his Jewish contemporaries.</p>
    <p>John’s introduction was much different than both Luke and Matthew.  John begins his story before the Creation of the world and he provides insight into the nature of who Jesus truly was, is and still is yet to be.  He tells us that Jesus’ ministry began before the world began and was a part of God in so far as He is one and the same with the God of the Old Testament.  This theology transcended the Jewish idea of a Messiah and was meant to appeal to a much wider audience than just the Jew or the Greek or the Roman or the Egyptian or the Mesopotamian cultures.  It was a message to all of Creation that our God loves the world and as proof He became flesh offering Himself as a sacrifice so that the creation could be redeemed to the point of having a relationship with Him.  A Holy God cannot dwell in an unholy vessel.  Therefore, in order to make the vessel holy, atonement became necessary, offering the choice (that was not present before) to choose between God’s grace or the existential bondage that comes from human pride.</p>
    <p>John begins his Gospel in this way (John 1:1-7; 9-14; 16-18):</p>
    <p><em>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was with God in the beginning. 3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. 4 In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome[a] it.  6 There was a man sent from God whose name was John. 7 He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe…9 The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. 11 He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. 12 Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God— 13 children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God.  14 The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth…16 Out of his fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given. 17 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and[b] is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known.” </em></p>
    <p>Here we see that John’s introduction of Jesus was much deeper than the historical record of Luke, or the argument-based approach of Matthew trying to convince Jews that the Messiah had come.  Rather, John was expressing a deep theological connection between Jesus and God that was only believable through faith and not human reason.</p>
    <p>Mark’s introduction to Jesus gets right to the point.  Mark was a companion of Peter in Rome after the death of Jesus and also was an early companion of Paul on his first missionary journey (see John Mark introduction).  Therefore, it is likely that Mark’s Gospel takes as its primary source the acts, sayings and testimony of Peter who was an eyewitness to the ministry of Jesus.  Mark and Peter seem to be less concerned with theological conventions and they get more to the point in their belief structure.  To Peter, through Mark, faith was not a choice, it was a duty, to which he owed to God, who had shown him compassion, love and mercy during his own life on Earth.  There was no question for Peter as to who Jesus was and so Mark’s account begins at the beginning of Jesus’ ministry because there was no further proof necessary in the mind of Peter other than what he had himself witnessed during the lifetime of Jesus.</p>
    <p>Therefore, Mark begins with the Gospel of repentance and baptism, the cornerstone of the Christian faith.  Mark 1:1-4 reads,</p>
    <p><em>“The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God, 2 as it is written in Isaiah the prophet:“I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way”- 3 “a voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’” 4 And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.”</em></p>

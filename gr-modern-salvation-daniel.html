    <h1>The Golden Ratio</h1>
    <h2>Salvation in the Modern Day</h2>
    <h4><em>Coming soon...</em></h4>

    <p>As we can see, the only work that is required of a Christian is for one to turn toward God, repent, confess and be baptized in the name of Jesus.  The rest of the “work” is done by the Holy Spirit living in us which then produces “good fruit” in keeping with repentance.  However, as we saw in the life of Jesus, even when Jesus is living amongst us, our spirit may be willing, but our flesh is certainly weak and thus as Paul shows, we must crucify ourselves daily to the flesh and continually repent of our sins (individually) so that we can remain in fellowship with the Holy One.</p>

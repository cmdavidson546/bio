    3.1.  The Beginnings of Jesus’ Earthly Ministry

3.1.1.  Baptism of Jesus (Mt. 3:13-17; Mk. 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-22)

John 1:15 (John testified concerning him. He cried out, saying, “This is the one I spoke about when I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’”)

Matthew 3:11 “I baptize you with[b] water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with[c] the Holy Spirit and fire. 12 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”

In Matthew 3:13-17, we read, “Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.  But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”  Jesus replied, “Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John consented.  As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.  And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”  

Mark 1:9-11, tells us, “At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.  Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.  And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.” And, in 

Luke 3:21-22 states, “When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.”

In these accounts show that in all four gospels we see that Jesus’ ministry truly gets underway marked by this baptism event.  But why?  Why would a symbolic logic event be necessary to activate Jesus’ ministry, and even to the modern day Christian, each of our own ministries?  We get an inkling of the reason through our Lord’s words when he says, “…it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.”

3.1.2.  Temptation of Jesus (Mt. 4:1-11; Mk 1:12-13; Luke 4:1-13)
	
Matt 4:1-11 gives us the account, “1 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. 2 After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. 3 The tempter came to him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.”

4 Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’[Deut. 8:3]”

5 Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. 6 “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down. For it is written:

“‘He will command his angels concerning you,
    and they will lift you up in their hands,
    so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’[Psalm 91:11,12]”

7 Jesus answered him, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’[Deut. 6:16]”

8 Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. 9 “All this I will give you,” he said, “if you will bow down and worship me.”

10 Jesus said to him, “Away from me, Satan! For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.’[Deut. 6:13]”

11 Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.”

Here we see that once the baptism ritual is complete, and the work of the Holy Spirit begins in a person, the first thing Jesus teaches us to do is to go out and strengthen our spiritual side to prepare for the battle ahead.  Many of us do not do this and rely solely on the Holy Spirit, in its very infancy stages in our lives as new believers, in order to overcome the real and powerful forces that move us toward sin in our everyday lives.  However, if we took, say 40 days, after being baptized, to dedicate ourselves to daily prayer, fasting and meditating on the things of God immediately after being baptized, we may see better results in our ability to withstand evil in our lives.

Jesus responds to Satan’s temptations with Scripture.  Plain and simple.  Its interesting to look at the things that Satan thought would persuade Jesus away from God’s work and towards sin: (1) first, Satan plays on Jesus’ basic need of being hungry after 40 days of fasting; (2) second, he then moves on to play on the doubts that can creep up in our hearts about whether God actually does exist and whether God will do what He said He would do in the Scripture; and (3) lastly, Satan attempts to deceive by saying he could give Jesus the kingdoms of the world if Jesus worshipped him.  Interestingly, this last one shows how deluded Satan had become to even think that he had the authority to “give” the kingdoms to anyone when they are in fact ruled by God.  But the fact remains, when all else fails, Satan lied in order to try to convince Jesus and he played on the delusional insecurities of man such that the lure of power, fame, riches, etc. (material wealth) would lure Him away from God’s purpose on His life.

Matt 4:17 then goes on to say, “17 From that time on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.”  And, in Matt 4:23 we read, “23 Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.”

Thus, once the baptism and strengthening of the spirit was completed, Jesus was ready for his ministry.  He had passed the test and his message was simple:  Repent.  That was the only work a person needed to do in order to be saved by Jesus.

Now, we also see that Jesus went out and did a few other things to show us what we should be doing after our repentance that is, “producing fruit in keeping with our repentance” as John the Baptist keys us into when he was talking to the Pharisees.  

1.  Go out…
2.  Teach the Good News to unbelievers…
3.  Heal…

3.1.3.  The Calling of a Disciple

	i.	The first disciples (Jn. 1:35-51)
	ii.	Making Contact with Jesus (Mt. 4:18-22; Mk. 1:16-20; Lk. 5:1-11)
	iii.	The Call to Serve (Mt. 9:9-13; Mk. 2:13-17; Lk. 5:27-32)
	iv.	The selection process (Mk. 3:13-19; Lk. 6:12-16)

Matt 4:18-22, “18 As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. 19 “Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for people.” 20 At once they left their nets and followed him.”

Here we see the first purpose of our lives revealed in Jesus’ call to serve Him and the appropriate response by a disciple.  “Follow” Him when He calls you.  You must be willing to leave everything behind you and respond immediately in order to be a true disciple of Jesus Christ.  Many of us fail in this regard whereby we try to “fit” Jesus into our busy lives or we ignore the daily call to repent or to follow the example of Jesus to help someone in need or go the extra mile at work or to turn the other cheek when wronged by others.  Luckily for us there is still time for repentance and renewal and for the work of the Holy Spirit to write in us a new heart that lives for Jesus rather than for ourselves.  

Charles Spurgeon’s sermon on this tells us (http://www.spurgeon.org/sermons/1906.php )

3.1.4.  The Profession of Faith in Jesus (Peter’s Confession)
	i.	Mt. 6:13-20
	ii.	Mk. 8:27-30
	iii.	Lk. 9:18-22

3.2.  The Teachings and Parables of Jesus

3.2.1.  Jesus’ Teachings

Jesus’ first recorded sermon is known as the “Sermon on the Mount” and is recorded in Matthew 5 through 7.  In it, Jesus first describes what the fruit of repentance looks like in our lives by detailing the beatitudes:

3 “Blessed are the poor in spirit,
    for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
4 Blessed are those who mourn,
    for they will be comforted.
5 Blessed are the meek,
    for they will inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
    for they will be filled.
7 Blessed are the merciful,
    for they will be shown mercy.
8 Blessed are the pure in heart,
    for they will see God.
9 Blessed are the peacemakers,
    for they will be called children of God.
10 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,
    for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
11 “Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. 12 Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

It is worth dissecting these statements one by one in order to show how the fruits of repentance should be played out in one’s life.

Martin Luther’s Sermon on this topic gives us insight (http://www.godrules.net/library/luther/37luther1.htm )

3.2.2.  Jesus’ Parables

In Matthew 5:13-16 we see Jesus follow the beatitudes of repentance with His first parable:

13 “You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.

14 “You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. 15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. 16 In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.”

3.2.3.  The Debate re: Faith vs. Works.  Getting it all Wrong

i.	Seeking to be Greater than Others (Mt. 20:17-28; Mk. 10:32-45; Lk. 18:31-34)
ii.	Seeking to belong to the World (Judas departs Last Supper; Suicide)
iii.	Seeking personal security (Peter’s denials of Jesus)
iv.	Not being watchful for the devil (Jesus in Gethsemene)

3.2.3.  Jesus’ Teachings and Prayer for Workers at the Last Supper

3.3.  The Miracles of Jesus

In Matt 4:23 we read, “23 Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.”
